            "abstract": "Recourse provides individuals who received undesirable labels (e.g., denied a loan) from algorithmic decision-making systems with a minimum-cost improvement suggestion to achieve the desired outcome. However, in practice, models often get updated to reflect changes in the data distribution or environment, invalidating the recourse recommendations (i.e., following the recourse will not lead to the desirable outcome). The robust recourse literature addresses this issue by providing a framework for computing recourses whose validity is resilient to slight changes in the model. However, since the optimization problem of computing robust recourse is non-convex (even for linear models), most of the current approaches do not have any theoretical guarantee on the optimality of the recourse. Recent work by Kayastha et. al. provides the first provably optimal algorithm for robust recourse with respect to generalized linear models when the model changes are measured using the $L^{\\infty}$ norm. However, using the $L^{\\infty}$ norm can lead to recourse solutions with a high price. To address this shortcoming, we consider more constrained model changes defined by the $L^p$ norm, where $p\\geq 1$ but $p\\neq \\infty$, and provide a new algorithm that provably computes the optimal robust recourse for generalized linear models. Empirically, for both linear and non-linear models, we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a significantly lower price of recourse (up to several orders of magnitude) compared to prior work and also exhibits a better trade-off between the implementation cost of recourse and its validity. Our empirical analysis also illustrates that our approach provides more sparse recourses compared to prior work and remains resilient to post-processing approaches that guarantee feasibility.",

            "abstract": "Clinicians face growing information overload from biomedical literature and guidelines, hindering evidence-based care. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models may provide fast, provenance-linked answers, but requires real-world evaluation. We describe iatroX, a UK-centred RAG-based clinical reference platform, and report early adoption, usability, and perceived clinical value from a formative implementation evaluation. Methods comprised a retrospective analysis of usage across web, iOS, and Android over 16 weeks (8 April-31 July 2025) and an in-product intercept survey. Usage metrics were drawn from web and app analytics with bot filtering. A client-side script randomized single-item prompts to approx. 10% of web sessions from a predefined battery assessing usefulness, reliability, and adoption intent. Proportions were summarized with Wilson 95% confidence intervals; free-text comments underwent thematic content analysis. iatroX reached 19,269 unique web users, 202,660 engagement events, and approx. 40,000 clinical queries. Mobile uptake included 1,960 iOS downloads and Android growth (peak >750 daily active users). The survey yielded 1,223 item-level responses: perceived usefulness 86.2% (95% CI 74.8-93.9%; 50/58); would use again 93.3% (95% CI 68.1-99.8%; 14/15); recommend to a colleague 88.4% (95% CI 75.1-95.9%; 38/43); perceived accuracy 75.0% (95% CI 58.8-87.3%; 30/40); reliability 79.4% (95% CI 62.1-91.3%; 27/34). Themes highlighted speed, guideline-linked answers, and UK specificity. Early real-world use suggests iatroX can mitigate information overload and support timely answers for UK clinicians. Limitations include small per-item samples and early-adopter bias; future work will include accuracy audits and prospective studies on workflow and care quality.",

We discuss the Kleibergen-Paap (KP) rank test as a heteroskedasticity-robust OID test and compare to the typical J-test. We derive the heteroskedastic weak-instrument limiting distributions for J and KP as special cases of the robust score test estimated via 2SLS and LIML respectively. Monte Carlo simulations show that KP usually performs better than J, which is prone to severe size distortions. Test size depends on model parameters not consistently estimable with weak instruments, so a conservative approach is recommended. This generalises recommendations to use LIML-based OID tests under homoskedasticity. We then revisit the classic problem of estimating the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS) in lifecycle consumption models. Lagged macroeconomic indicators should provide naturally valid but frequently weak instruments. The literature provides a wide range of estimates for this parameter, and J frequently rejects the null of valid instruments. J often rejects the null whereas KP does not; we suggest that J over-rejects, sometimes severely. We argue that KP-test should be used over the J-test. We also argue that instrument invalidity/misspecification is unlikely the cause of the range of EIS estimates in the literature.",

KD for recommender systems targets at distilling rankings, especially among items most likely to be preferred, and can only be computed on a small subset of items. Considering these features, we reveal the connection between CE loss and NDCG in the field of KD. We prove that when performing KD on an item subset, minimizing CE loss maximizes the lower bound of NDCG, only if an assumption of closure is satisfied. It requires that the item subset consists of the student's top items. However, this contradicts our goal of distilling rankings of the teacher's top items. We empirically demonstrate the vast gap between these two kinds of top items. To bridge the gap between our goal and theoretical support, we propose Rejuvenated Cross-Entropy for Knowledge Distillation (RCE-KD). It splits the top items given by the teacher into two subsets based on whether they are highly ranked by the student. For the subset that defies the condition, a sampling strategy is devised to use teacher-student collaboration to approximate our assumption of closure. We also combine the losses on the two subsets adaptively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RCE-KD.",

            "abstract": "In modern GPU inference, cache efficiency remains a major bottleneck. In recommendation models, embedding hit rates largely determine throughput, while in large language models, KV-cache misses substantially increase time-to-first-token (TTFT). Heuristic policies such as \\textsc{LRU} often struggle under structured access patterns. Learning-based approaches are promising, but in practice face two major limitations: they degrade sharply when predictions are inaccurate, or they gain little even with accurate predictions due to conservative designs. Some also incur high overhead, further limiting practicality.   We present \\textsc{LCR}, a practical framework for learning-based GPU caching that delivers performance gains while ensuring robustness and efficiency. Its core algorithm, \\textsc{LARU}, enhances \\textsc{LRU} with machine-learned predictions and dynamically adapts to prediction accuracy through online error estimation. When predictions are accurate, \\textsc{LARU} achieves near-optimal performance. With inaccurate predictions, it degrades gracefully to near-\\textsc{LRU} performance. With \\textsc{LCR}, we bridge the gap between empirical progress and theoretical advances in learning-based caching.   Experiments show that \\textsc{LCR} delivers consistent gains under realistic conditions. In DLRM and LLM scenarios, it improves throughput by up to 24.2\\% and reduces P99 TTFT by up to 28.3\\%, outperforming widely used inference systems. Even under poor predictions, its performance remains stable, demonstrating practical robustness.",

However, current research on SIDs faces three main challenges: (1) the absence of large-scale public datasets with multimodal features, (2) limited investigation into optimization strategies for SID generation, which typically rely on costly GR training for evaluation, and (3) slow online convergence in industrial deployment. To address these challenges, we propose FORGE, a comprehensive benchmark for FOrming semantic identifieR in Generative rEtrieval with industrial datasets. Specifically, FORGE is equipped with a dataset comprising 14 billion user interactions and multimodal features of 250 million items sampled from Taobao, one of the biggest e-commerce platforms in China. Leveraging this dataset, FORGE explores several optimizations to enhance the SID construction and validates their effectiveness via offline experiments across different settings and tasks. Further online analysis conducted on our platform, which serves over 300 million users daily, reveals a 0.35% increase in transaction count, highlighting the practical impact of our method. Regarding the expensive SID validation accompanied by the full training of GRs, we propose two novel metrics of SID that correlate positively with recommendation performance, enabling convenient evaluations without any GR training. For real-world applications, FORGE introduces an offline pretraining schema that reduces online convergence by half. The code and data are available at https://github.com/selous123/al_sid.",

The widespread adoption of hybrid work following the COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally transformed software development practices, introducing new challenges in communication and collaboration as organizations transition from traditional office-based structures to flexible working arrangements. This shift has established a new organizational norm where even traditionally office-first companies now embrace hybrid team structures. While remote participation in meetings has become commonplace in this new environment, it may lead to isolation, alienation, and decreased engagement among remote team members. Aims. This study aims to identify and characterize engagement patterns in hybrid meetings through objective measurements, focusing on the differences between co-located and remote participants. Method. We studied professionals from three software companies over several weeks, employing a multimodal approach to measure engagement. Data were collected through self-reported questionnaires and physiological measurements using biometric devices during hybrid meetings to understand engagement dynamics. Results. The regression analyses revealed comparable engagement levels between onsite and remote participants, though remote participants show lower engagement in long meetings regardless of participation mode. Active roles positively correlate with higher engagement, while larger meetings and afternoon sessions are associated with lower engagement. Conclusions. Our results offer insights into factors associated with engagement and disengagement in hybrid meetings, as well as potential meeting improvement recommendations. These insights are potentially relevant not only for software teams but also for knowledge-intensive organizations across various sectors facing similar hybrid collaboration challenges.",

            "abstract": "This document offers a synthesis of recent economic literature on three interconnected areas of labor markets: informality, the effects of the minimum wage, and monopsony power. Through the consolidation and meta-analysis of findings from multiple existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses, their causes, consequences, and associated public policies are examined. It is concluded that conventional views on these topics often overestimate the magnitude of effects. Policies to reduce informality based solely on lowering formalization costs are largely ineffective, while increased enforcement at the extensive margin shows more promising results. The effects of the minimum wage on employment, measured through the own-wage elasticity (OWE), are consistently modest, suggesting that job losses are limited compared to wage gains. To reconcile and microfound these findings, an integrated theoretical model of firm optimization is introduced, simultaneously incorporating firm heterogeneity, monopsony power, and endogenous formality decisions, rigorously demonstrating how the interaction of these forces can explain the observed empirical regularities. A cross-cutting and significant finding is the omnipresence of publication bias across all these study areas, which tends to inflate the magnitude of the effects reported in the published literature. Corrected estimates of the effects generally approach zero. Meta-regression is established as an indispensable tool for identifying heterogeneity and the true underlying effects in the empirical evidence, compelling a recalibration of both theory and economic policy recommendations towards a more nuanced and integrated approach.",

This study develops a three-step approach using cost of healthy diet to inform targeted nutrition programming in Indonesia. We combine detailed retail prices and household survey data from Indonesia to describe how reported consumption and expenditure patterns across all levels of household income diverge from least cost healthy diets using items from nearby markets. In this analysis, we examine regional price variations, identify households with insufficient income for healthy diets, and analyze the nutrient adequacy of reported consumption patterns. We find that household food spending was sufficient to meet national dietary guidelines using the least expensive locally available items for over 98% of Indonesians, but almost all households consume substantial quantities of discretionary foods and mixed dishes while consuming too little energy from fruits, vegetables, and legumes, nuts, and seeds. Households with higher incomes have higher nutrient adequacy and are closer to meeting local dietary guidelines, but still fall short of recommendations. These findings shed new light on how actual food demand differs from least-cost healthy diets, due to factors other than affordability, such as taste, convenience, and aspirations shaped by marketing and other sociocultural influences.",

Standard meta-learning approaches aim to solve this by selecting an algorithm based on user features, but treat the fundamentally diverse algorithms themselves as equivalent, \"black-box\" choices. This thesis investigates the impact of overcoming this limitation by engineering a comprehensive feature set to explicitly characterize the algorithms themselves. We combine static code metrics, Abstract Syntax Tree properties, behavioral performance landmarks, and high-level conceptual features. We evaluate two meta-learners across five datasets: a baseline using only user features and our proposed model using both user and algorithm features. Our results show that the meta-learner augmented with algorithm features achieves an average NDCG@10 of 0.143, a statistically significant improvement of 11.7% over the Single Best Algorithm baseline (0.128). However, we found that the inclusion of algorithm features did not lead to an improvement in overall NDCG@10 over the meta learner using only user features (0.144). While adding algorithm features to the meta-learner did improve its Top-1 selection accuracy (+16.1%), this was counterbalanced by leading to a lower Top-3 accuracy (-10.7%). We conclude that for the per-user algorithm selection task in recommender systems, the predictive power of user features is overwhelmingly dominant. While algorithm features improve selection precision, unlocking their potential to boost overall performance remains a non-trivial challenge.",

Systems design approaches to AI-powered recommender systems have done well to urge recommender system developers to follow more intentional data collection, curation, and management procedures. So too has the \"human-in-the-loop\" paradigm been widely adopted, primarily to address the issue of accountability. However, in this paper, we take the position that human oversight in recommender system design also entails novel risks that have yet to be fully described. These risks are \"codetermined\" by the information context in which such systems are often deployed. Furthermore, new knowledge of the shortcomings of \"human-in-the-loop\" practices to deliver meaningful oversight of other AI systems suggest that they may also be inadequate for achieving socially responsible recommendations. We review how the limitations of human oversight may increase the chances of a specific kind of failure: a \"cascade\" or \"compound\" failure. We then briefly explore how the unique dynamics of three common deployment contexts can make humans in the loop more likely to fail in their oversight duties. We then conclude with two recommendations.",

Although reflected sunlight and emissions all across the electromagnetic spectrum from artificial satellites impact scientific observations and the sky, the workshop focused on reflected sunlight in the wavelength range 330 nm to 1100 nm. This aligns with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) planned imaging observations over the coming decade. Among other conclusions, we affirm previous recommendations that tracked satellite apparent magnitudes should be no brighter than 7th AB mag. The workshop participants discussed over 30 publications, reports, and presentations, and arrived at the Findings and Recommendations presented here. During the workshop, in addition to affirming many existing recommendations and best practices, the group discovered new issues and devised possible mitigations. These were nearly equally divided between advice to satellite builders and operators and to the observational astronomy community. While the workshop prioritized considerations for LSST, our hope is that many of the Findings and Recommendations will also apply to other observatories and constellations, and that all satellite companies will continue to engage in dialog with sky observers across the globe.",

To select the optimal subset of clips that maximize performance for a specific task (image-based disease classification), we propose a method optimized through reinforcement learning. In our method, an agent learns to either keep processing view-specific clips to reduce the disease classification uncertainty, or stop processing if the achieved classification confidence is sufficient. Furthermore, we propose a learnable attention-based aggregation method as a flexible way of fusing information from multiple clips. The proposed method obtains an AUC of 0.91 on the task of detecting cardiac amyloidosis using only 30% of all clips, exceeding the performance achieved from using all clips and from other benchmarks.",

Drawing upon prior work in designing teachable social media feeds, we built Pilot, a novel system of controls and feedback mechanisms on BlueSky that are expressive, intuitive, and integrated directly into the feed to allow users to customize their feed while they browse. Our user study suggests the system increases the user's sense of agency, and encourages them to think more critically about curating their feeds.

Experiments on diverse datasets-medical imaging (X-ray pneumonia), vision benchmarks (MNIST, FMNIST), and tabular agricultural data (Crop Recommendation)-demonstrate that FedFiTS consistently outperforms FedAvg, FedRand, and FedPow in accuracy, time-to-target, and resilience to poisoning attacks. By integrating trust-aware aggregation with fairness-oriented client selection, FedFiTS advances scalable and secure FL, making it well suited for real-world healthcare and cross-domain deployments.",

To understand this phenomenon, we investigate LLMs through the lens of classic code metrics. Surprisingly, we find that a classifier trained solely on these metrics performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs for vulnerability discovery. A root-cause analysis reveals a strong correlation and a causal effect between LLMs and code metrics: When the value of a metric is changed, LLM predictions tend to shift by a corresponding magnitude. This dependency suggests that LLMs operate at a similarly shallow level as code metrics, limiting their ability to grasp complex patterns and fully realize their potential in vulnerability discovery. Based on these findings, we derive recommendations on how research should more effectively address this challenge.",

Mastering extended geospatial-temporal trajectories is critical for next-generation MLLMs, underpinning real-world tasks such as embodied-AI planning and navigation. To bridge this gap, we present VIR-Bench, a novel benchmark consisting of 200 travel videos that frames itinerary reconstruction as a challenging task designed to evaluate and push forward MLLMs' geospatial-temporal intelligence. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, struggle to achieve high scores, underscoring the difficulty of handling videos that span extended spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, we conduct an in-depth case study in which we develop a prototype travel-planning agent that leverages the insights gained from VIR-Bench. The agent's markedly improved itinerary recommendations verify that our evaluation protocol not only benchmarks models effectively but also translates into concrete performance gains in user-facing applications.",

Protective ventilation strategies are recommended, yet implementation in neonatal intensive care units remains inconsistent, and infants continue to be exposed to injurious ventilator settings. Objective: To develop and validate a cohort of neonatal digital twins, based on mechanistic models of cardiopulmonary physiology calibrated to individual patient data, as a tool for simulating and optimising protective ventilation strategies. Methods: A high-fidelity computational simulator of human cardiopulmonary physiology was adapted to neonatal-specific parameters, including lung compliance, dead space, pulmonary vascular resistance, oxygen consumption, and fetal haemoglobin oxygen affinity. Digital twins were generated using data at 65 time points from 11 preterm neonates receiving volume-controlled ventilation. Model parameters were calibrated to minimise the error between simulated and observed PaO2, PaCO2, and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP). Results: Digital twins reproduced measured data with mean absolute percentage errors of 3.9% (PaO2), 3.0% (PaCO2), and 5.8% (PIP) across the cohort. Predictions for uncalibrated variables (pHa, SaO2, mean and minimum airway pressure) also showed high accuracy, with errors <5%. Strong correlations and narrow limits of agreement were observed across all patients and time points. Conclusions: This study demonstrates, for the first time, the feasibility of creating fully mechanistic digital twins of mechanically ventilated neonates with RDS. The twins accurately captured patient-specific gas exchange and respiratory mechanics, supporting their potential as a platform for conducting virtual clinical trials and for the design of individualized, lung-protective ventilation strategies.",

This structure is translated into natural language explanations using carefully designed LLM prompts. Many works in explainable AI rely on automatic evaluation metrics, which often fail to capture users' actual needs and perceptions. In contrast, we adopt a user-centered approach: we conduct a study with 326 participants who assessed the quality of the explanations across five key dimensions-transparency, effectiveness, persuasion, trust, and satisfaction-as well as the recommendations themselves.To evaluate how different explanation strategies are perceived, we generate multiple explanation types from the same underlying model, varying the input information provided to the LLM. Our analysis reveals that all explanation types are generally well received, with moderate statistical differences between strategies.

The latter model typically reranks the item list conditioned on the user's history content and the initial ranking from retrievers. Although this two-stage retrieval-ranking framework demonstrates practical effectiveness, the significance of retriever scores from the previous stage has been limitedly explored, which is informative. In this work, we first theoretically analyze the limitations of using retriever scores as the rerankers' input directly and argue that the reranking task is essentially a noise reduction problem from the retriever scores. Following this notion, we derive an adversarial framework, DNR, that associates the denoising reranker with a carefully designed noise generation module. We extend the conventional score error minimization term with three augmented objectives, including: 1) a denoising objective that aims to denoise the noisy retriever scores to align with the user feedback; 2) an adversarial retriever score generation objective that improves the exploration in the retriever score space; and 3) a distribution regularization term that aims to align the distribution of generated noisy retriever scores with the real ones. Extensive experiments are conducted on three public datasets, together with analytical support, validating the effectiveness of the proposed DNR.",

These challenges disproportionately impact patients in low-resource and rural settings. Here, we utilized a large academic health system as a data engine to develop Prima, the first vision language model (VLM) serving as an AI foundation for neuroimaging that supports real-world, clinical MRI studies as input. Trained on over 220,000 MRI studies, Prima uses a hierarchical vision architecture that provides general and transferable MRI features. Prima was tested in a 1-year health system-wide study that included 30K MRI studies. Across 52 radiologic diagnoses from the major neurologic disorders, including neoplastic, inflammatory, infectious, and developmental lesions, Prima achieved a mean diagnostic area under the ROC curve of 92.0, outperforming other state-of-the-art general and medical AI models. Prima offers explainable differential diagnoses, worklist priority for radiologists, and clinical referral recommendations across diverse patient demographics and MRI systems. Prima demonstrates algorithmic fairness across sensitive groups and can help mitigate health system biases, such as prolonged turnaround times for low-resource populations. These findings highlight the transformative potential of health system-scale VLMs and Prima's role in advancing AI-driven healthcare.",

However, LLMs often find Math Word Problems (MWPs) challenging because solving them requires a range of reasoning and mathematical abilities with which LLMs seem to struggle. Recent efforts have helped LLMs solve more complex MWPs with improved prompts. This study proposes a novel method that initially prompts an LLM to create equations from a decomposition of the question, followed by using an external symbolic equation solver to produce an answer. To ensure the accuracy of the obtained answer, inspired by an established recommendation of math teachers, the LLM is instructed to solve the MWP a second time, but this time with the objective of estimating the correct answer instead of solving it exactly. The estimation is then compared to the generated answer to verify. If verification fails, an iterative rectification process is employed to ensure the correct answer is eventually found. This approach achieves new state-of-the-art results on datasets used by prior published research on numeric and algebraic MWPs, improving the previous best results by nearly two percent on average. In addition, the approach obtains satisfactory results on trigonometric MWPs, a task not previously attempted to the authors' best knowledge.

To overcome these problems, we present a new framework that identifies noisy ratings. In this context, the proposed framework is modular, consisting of three layers: known natural noise algorithms for item classification, an Ensemble learning model for refined evaluation of the items and signature-based noise identification.

Yet, despite a surge of interest, the field lacks a principled understanding of the capabilities of LLMs in their interaction with graph data. In this work, we conduct a large-scale, controlled evaluation across several key axes of variability to systematically assess the strengths and weaknesses of LLM-based graph reasoning methods in text-based applications. The axes include the LLM-graph interaction mode, comparing prompting, tool-use, and code generation; dataset domains, spanning citation, web-link, e-commerce, and social networks; structural regimes contrasting homophilic and heterophilic graphs; feature characteristics involving both short- and long-text node attributes; and model configurations with varying LLM sizes and reasoning capabilities. We further analyze dependencies by methodically truncating features, deleting edges, and removing labels to quantify reliance on input types. Our findings provide practical and actionable guidance. (1) LLMs as code generators achieve the strongest overall performance on graph data, with especially large gains on long-text or high-degree graphs where prompting quickly exceeds the token budget. (2) All interaction strategies remain effective on heterophilic graphs, challenging the assumption that LLM-based methods collapse under low homophily. (3) Code generation is able to flexibly adapt its reliance between structure, features, or labels to leverage the most informative input type. Together, these findings provide a comprehensive view of the strengths and limitations of current LLM-graph interaction modes and highlight key design principles for future approaches.",

To this end, we introduce VoxGuard, a framework grounded in differential privacy and membership inference that formalizes two complementary notions: User Privacy, preventing speaker re-identification, and Attribute Privacy, protecting sensitive traits such as gender and accent. Across synthetic and real datasets, we find that informed adversaries, especially those using fine-tuned models and max-similarity scoring, achieve orders-of-magnitude stronger attacks at low-FPR despite similar EER. For attributes, we show that simple transparent attacks recover gender and accent with near-perfect accuracy even after anonymization. Our results demonstrate that EER substantially underestimates leakage, highlighting the need for low-FPR evaluation, and recommend VoxGuard as a benchmark for evaluating privacy leakage.",

However, the resolution and sensitivity still impose constraints on interpretation. We investigate the uncertainties inherent to high-$z$ galaxy kinematical analysis by modelling a suite of rotating disk galaxies, generating synthetic interferometric ALMA observations, and fitting them with the 3D-kinematical tools 3DBarolo, GalPaK3D, and Qubefit. We present the recovered 3D-fitted kinematical parameters to assess their reliability, quantify the range of values possible for individual source studies, and establish the systematic biases present for observed samples. The $V/\\sigma_{\\rm V}$ ratio, which indicates how dynamically cold a system is, is of particular importance and depends on the choice of 3D-fitting tool. On average, 3DBarolo and Qubefit slightly overestimates $V/\\sigma_{\\rm V}$ ($<1\\sigma$) and GalPaK3D underestimates it ($<2\\sigma$). Therefore, all three tools are reliable for kinematical studies of averages of high-redshift galaxy samples. The value range possible for individual sources is significant, however, even more so for samples of not purely rotation dominated sources. To determine whether an observed galaxy is rotation dominated enough to be fitted with a 3D-kinematical tool, $V/\\sigma_{\\rm V}$ can be extracted directly from the observed data cube, with some caveats. We recommend that the median offsets, value ranges, and tool-dependent biases presented in this paper are taken into account when interpreting 3D-fitted kinematics of observed high-redshift galaxies.",

From a first principle perspective, the breakthroughs of LLMs stem not only from their architectures but also from two complementary mechanisms: context engineering, which enriches raw input queries with contextual cues to better elicit model capabilities, and multi-step reasoning, which iteratively refines model outputs through intermediate reasoning paths. However, these two mechanisms and their potential to unlock substantial improvements remain largely underexplored in industrial ranking systems.   In this paper, we propose OnePiece, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates LLM-style context engineering and reasoning into both retrieval and ranking models of industrial cascaded pipelines. OnePiece is built on a pure Transformer backbone and further introduces three key innovations: (1) structured context engineering, which augments interaction history with preference and scenario signals and unifies them into a structured tokenized input sequence for both retrieval and ranking; (2) block-wise latent reasoning, which equips the model with multi-step refinement of representations and scales reasoning bandwidth via block size; (3) progressive multi-task training, which leverages user feedback chains to effectively supervise reasoning steps during training. OnePiece has been deployed in the main personalized search scenario of Shopee and achieves consistent online gains across different key business metrics, including over $+2\\%$ GMV/UU and a $+2.90\\%$ increase in advertising revenue.",

            "abstract": "Selecting a solution algorithm for the Facility Layout Problem (FLP), an NP-hard optimization problem with a multiobjective trade-off, is a complex task that requires deep expert knowledge. The performance of a given algorithm depends on specific problem characteristics such as its scale, objectives, and constraints. This creates a need for a data-driven recommendation method to guide algorithm selection in automated design systems. This paper introduces a new recommendation method to make such expertise accessible, based on a Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG RAG) framework. To address this, a domain-specific knowledge graph is constructed from published literature. The method then employs a multi-faceted retrieval mechanism to gather relevant evidence from this knowledge graph using three distinct approaches, which include a precise graph-based search, flexible vector-based search, and high-level cluster-based search. The retrieved evidence is utilized by a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate algorithm recommendations with data-driven reasoning. The proposed KG-RAG method is compared against a commercial LLM chatbot with access to the knowledge base as a table, across a series of diverse, real-world FLP test cases. Based on recommendation accuracy and reasoning capability, the proposed method performed significantly better than the commercial LLM chatbot.",

While ALS is widely used for providing personalized recommendations based on user-item interaction data, its high computational cost, stemming from repeated regression operations, poses significant challenges for large-scale datasets. To enhance the efficiency of ALS, we propose a core-elements subsampling method that selects a representative subset of data and leverages sparse matrix operations to approximate ALS estimations efficiently. We establish theoretical guarantees for the approximation and convergence of the proposed approach, showing that it achieves similar accuracy with significantly reduced computational time compared to full-data ALS.

Existing scoring systems, such as CVSS and EPSS, offer limited support for this task. They either rely on theoretical metrics or produce opaque probability estimates without assessing whether usable exploit code exists. In practice, security teams often resort to manual triage of exploit repositories, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to scale. We present AEAS, an automated system designed to assess and prioritize actionable exploits through static analysis. AEAS analyzes both exploit code and associated documentation to extract a structured set of features reflecting exploit availability, functionality, and setup complexity. It then computes an actionability score for each exploit and produces ranked exploit recommendations. We evaluate AEAS on a dataset of over 5,000 vulnerabilities derived from 600+ real-world applications frequently encountered by red teams. Manual validation and expert review on representative subsets show that AEAS achieves a 100% top-3 success rate in recommending functional exploits and shows strong alignment with expert-validated rankings.

This unreliability renders \"out-of-the-box\" GPT unsuitable for deployment in education or engineering practice.

Agency first launches N instantiations of Agent Solve to yield N independent Proposed Problem Solution Realizations; Agency then invokes Agent Compare to summarize and compare the N Proposed Problem Solution Realizations and to provide a Recommended Problem Solution. We argue from Condorcet's Jury Theorem that, for a Problem Statement characterized by per-Solve success probability greater than 1/2 (and N sufficiently large), the Predominant (Agent Compare) Proposed Problem Solution will, with high probability, correspond to a Correct Proposed Problem Solution. Furthermore, Agent Compare can also incorporate aspects of Secondary (Agent Compare) Proposed Problem Solutions, in particular when the latter represent alternative Problem Statement interpretations - different Mathematical Models - or alternative Mathematical Solution Procedures.

Even worse, when dealing with scenarios where we need to learn or optimize functions with orientations as inputs and/or outputs, the set of possibilities (representations, loss functions, etc.) is even larger and it is not easy to decide what is best for each scenario. In this paper, we attempt to a) present clearly, concisely and with unified notation all available representations, and \"tricks\" related to 3D orientations (including Lie Group algebra), and b) benchmark them in representative scenarios. The first part feels like it is missing from the robotics literature as one has to read many different textbooks and papers in order have a concise and clear understanding of all possibilities, while the benchmark is necessary in order to come up with recommendations based on empirical evidence. More precisely, we experiment with the following settings that attempt to cover most widely used scenarios in robotics: 1) direct optimization, 2) imitation/supervised learning with a neural network controller, 3) reinforcement learning, and 4) trajectory optimization using differential dynamic programming.

However, existing prompt-based synthesis methods struggle to capture domain-specific data distributions, particularly in data-scarce domains, and often overlook fine-grained relevance diversity. In this paper, we present a Chinese short video dataset with 4-level relevance annotations, filling a critical resource void. Further, we propose a semi-supervised synthetic data pipeline where two collaboratively trained models generate domain-adaptive short video data with controllable relevance labels. Our method enhances relevance-level diversity by synthesizing samples for underrepresented intermediate relevance labels, resulting in a more balanced and semantically rich training data set. Extensive offline experiments show that the embedding model trained on our synthesized data outperforms those using data generated based on prompting or vanilla supervised fine-tuning(SFT). Moreover, we demonstrate that incorporating more diverse fine-grained relevance levels in training data enhances the model's sensitivity to subtle semantic distinctions, highlighting the value of fine-grained relevance supervision in embedding learning. In the search enhanced recommendation pipeline of Douyin's dual-column scenario, through online A/B testing, the proposed model increased click-through rate(CTR) by 1.45%, raised the proportion of Strong Relevance Ratio (SRR) by 4.9%, and improved the Image User Penetration Rate (IUPR) by 0.1054%.",

Its central challenge is determining whether, and by how much, to increase the sample size at an interim analysis. This decision requires a rational framework for balancing the potential gain in statistical power against the risk and cost of further investment. Prevailing optimization approaches, such as the Jennison and Turnbull (JT) method, address this by maximizing power for a fixed cost per additional participant. While statistically efficient, this paradigm assumes the cost of enrolling another patient is constant, regardless of whether the interim evidence is promising or weak. This can lead to impractical recommendations and inefficient resource allocation, particularly in weak-signal scenarios.   We reframe SSR as a decision problem under dynamic costs, where the effective cost of additional enrollment reflects the interim strength of evidence. Within this framework, we derive two novel rules: (i) a likelihood-ratio based rule, shown to be Pareto optimal in achieving smaller average sample size under the null without loss of power under the alternative; and (ii) a return-on-investment (ROI) rule that directly incorporates economic considerations by linking SSR decisions to expected net benefit. To unify existing methods, we further establish a representation theorem demonstrating that a broad class of SSR rules can be expressed through implicit dynamic cost functions, providing a common analytical foundation for their comparison. Simulation studies calibrated to Phase III trial settings confirm that dynamic-cost approaches improve resource allocation relative to fixed-cost methods.",

            "abstract": "Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is the premier method for characterizing the nanoscale surface pores in ultrafiltration (UF) membranes and the support layers of reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Based on SEM, the conventional understanding is that membranes typically have low surface porosities of <10%. We hypothesized that high acceleration voltage during SEM imaging and sputter metal coatings required for SEM have led to systematic underestimations of porosity and pore size. We showed that imaging a commercial UF membrane at 1, 5, and 10 kV reduced measured porosity from 10.3% (1 kV) to 6.3% (10 kV), while increasing Pt coating thickness from 1.5 to 5 nm lowered porosity by 54% for the UF membrane (12.9% to 5.8%) and 46% for an RO support (13.1% to 7.0%). To account for coating thickness, we developed a digital correction method that simulates pore dilation, enabling the pore structure to be estimated for uncoated membranes. Dilation yielded uncoated porosity values of 23% for the UF membrane and 20% for the RO support, about 3-fold greater than values observed with a 4 nm coating. Mean pore diameters were 2-fold greater for the UF membrane and 1.5-fold greater for the RO support. Critically, dilation-derived pore-size distributions agreed with low-flux dextran-retention data fitted with the Bungay-Brenner model. Our results suggest that surface porosities and pore sizes of nanoporous membranes are much larger than previously understood, with major implications for structure/transport relationships. For future nanoscale pore analysis of membranes (and other nanoporous materials), we recommend low acceleration voltage (1 kV), minimal coatings (1-2 nm), and digital dilation to account for coating artifacts",

This is particularly important for those at higher health risks and their care providers, allowing for better risk interpretation which may lead to more informed decisions. However, the kinds of visualizations used to represent data may impart biases that influence data interpretation and decision making. Both continuous representations using bar charts and discrete representations using icon arrays are pervasive in health risk communication, but express the same quantities using fundamentally different visual paradigms. We conducted a series of studies to investigate how bar charts, icon arrays, and their layout (juxtaposed, explicit encoding, explicit encoding plus juxtaposition) affect the perception of value comparison and subsequent decision-making in health risk communication. Our results suggest that icon arrays and explicit encoding combined with juxtaposition can optimize for both accurate difference estimation and perceptual biases in decision making. We also found misalignment between estimation accuracy and decision making, as well as between low and high literacy groups, emphasizing the importance of tailoring visualization approaches to specific audiences and evaluating visualizations beyond perceptual accuracy alone. This research contributes empirically-grounded design recommendations to improve comparison in health risk communication and support more informed decision-making across domains.",

This paper examines eight real-world deployments spanning seven countries and 18 languages, combining 17 interviews with AI developers and domain experts with secondary research. Our findings identify six cross-cutting factors - Language, Domain, Demography, Institution, Task, and Safety - that structured how systems were designed and deployed. These factors were shaped by sociocultural (diversity, practices), institutional (resources, policies), and technological (capabilities, limits) influences. We find that building AI systems required extensive collaboration between AI developers and domain experts. Notably, human resources proved more critical to achieving safe and effective systems in high-stakes domains than technological expertise alone. We present an analytical framework that synthesizes these dynamics and conclude with recommendations for designing AI for social good systems that are culturally grounded, equitable, and responsive to the needs of non-Western contexts.",

It is well known that the effectiveness of such methods depends crucially on the relative correlations and computational costs of the available computational models. However, the question of how to automatically tune low-fidelity models to maximize performance remains an open area of research. This work investigates automated model tuning, which optimizes model hyperparameters to minimize estimator variance within a target computational budget. Focusing on multifidelity trajectory simulation estimators, the cost-versus-precision tradeoff enabled by this approach is demonstrated in a practical, online setting where upfront tuning costs cannot be amortized. Using a real-world entry, descent, and landing example, it is shown that automated model tuning largely outperforms hand-tuned models even when the overall computational budget is relatively low. Furthermore, for scenarios where the computational budget is large, model tuning solutions can approach the best-case multifidelity estimator performance where optimal model hyperparameters are known a priori. Recommendations for applying model tuning in practice are provided and avenues for enabling adoption of such approaches for budget-constrained problems are highlighted.",

The quantitative description of DDCS for emission products presents a persistent theoretical challenge, primarily due to the more intricate effects of energy levels than those of 1p-shell nuclei. The pick-up mechanism of complex particles, as one of the important components of statistical theory for light nuclear reactions (STLN), is improved to describe the DDCS of outgoing charged particles, considering the effect of energy levels with energy, angular momentum and parity conservations. A comprehensive analysis of all open reaction channels is performed for $n + ^{19}$F reaction below 20 MeV. After ensuring the acquisition of high-quality DDCS of the emitted neutrons, the DDCS of outgoing charged particles (including $p, d, t, \\alpha$) are self-consistently obtained. The results of this work are not only in good agreement with the recently measured experimental data at $E_n$=14.2 MeV, but also superior to the data recommended by the current major nuclear databases. Thus, LUNF code for $n + ^{19}$F reaction is developed to obtain the ENDF-6 formatted DDCS file of the nucleon and light composite charged particles.",

In this document, we introduce a formal framework for the concept of fuzzy vertex pooling (FVP) and provide an overview of its key properties with its applications to neural networks. The pooling model demonstrates remarkable efficiency in minimizing loss rapidly while maintaining competitive accuracy, even with fewer hidden layer neurons. However, this advantage diminishes over extended training periods or with larger datasets, where the model's performance tends to degrade. This study highlights the limitations of pooling in later stages of deep learning training, rendering it less effective for prolonged or large-scale applications.

Recent efforts focus on components beyond the scaling embedding dimension, as it is believed that scaling embedding may lead to performance degradation. Although there have been some initial observations on embedding, the root cause of their non-scalability remains unclear. Moreover, whether performance degradation occurs across different types of models and datasets is still an unexplored area. Regarding the effect of embedding dimensions on performance, we conduct large-scale experiments across 10 datasets with varying sparsity levels and scales, using 4 representative classical architectures. We surprisingly observe two novel phenomenon: double-peak and logarithmic. For the former, as the embedding dimension increases, performance first improves, then declines, rises again, and eventually drops. For the latter, it exhibits a perfect logarithmic curve. Our contributions are threefold. First, we discover two novel phenomena when scaling collaborative filtering models. Second, we gain an understanding of the underlying causes of the double-peak phenomenon. Lastly, we theoretically analyze the noise robustness of collaborative filtering models, with results matching empirical observations.",

Results show that narrative framings were most preferred but encouraged uncritical overreliance, while authority framings were least preferred yet supported calibrated trust.

However, their inherent stochasticity and multi-step decision processes render classical evaluation methods inadequate for diagnosing agentic performance. This work introduces a diagnostic framework for expert systems that not only evaluates but also facilitates the transfer of expert behaviour into LLM-powered agents. The framework integrates (i) curated golden datasets of expert annotations, (ii) silver datasets generated through controlled behavioural mutation, and (iii) an LLM-based Agent Judge that scores and prescribes targeted improvements. These prescriptions are embedded into a vectorized recommendation map, allowing expert interventions to propagate as reusable improvement trajectories across multiple system instances. We demonstrate the framework on a multi-agent recruiter-assistant system, showing that it uncovers latent cognitive failures - such as biased phrasing, extraction drift, and tool misrouting - while simultaneously steering agents toward expert-level reasoning and style.

CF maximized retention, but the fixed path achieved the highest mastery.

In this paper, we uncover accuracy differences of up to 11% due to this (seemingly irrelevant) tokenization variation as well as reshuffled model rankings, raising concerns about the reliability of LLM comparisons in prior work. Surprisingly, we are able to recommend one specific strategy -- tokenizing the space together with the answer letter -- as we observe consistent and statistically significant performance improvements. Additionally, it improves model calibration, enhancing the reliability of the model's confidence estimates. Our findings underscore the importance of careful evaluation design and highlight the need for standardized, transparent evaluation protocols to ensure reliable and comparable results.",

This typically involves three stages: processing item text, extracting features with LLMs, and adapting them for downstream models. However, existing methods vary widely in prompting, architecture, and adaptation strategies, making it difficult to fairly compare design choices and identify what truly drives performance. In this work, we propose RecXplore, a modular analytical framework that decomposes the LLM-as-feature-extractor pipeline into four modules: data processing, semantic feature extraction, feature adaptation, and sequential modeling. Instead of proposing new techniques, RecXplore revisits and organizes established methods, enabling systematic exploration of each module in isolation. Experiments on four public datasets show that simply combining the best designs from existing techniques without exhaustive search yields up to 18.7% relative improvement in NDCG@5 and 12.7% in HR@5 over strong baselines. These results underscore the utility of modular benchmarking for identifying effective design patterns and promoting standardized research in LLM-enhanced recommendation.",

            "abstract": "Music is characterized by aspects related to different modalities, such as the audio signal, the lyrics, or the music video clips. This has motivated the development of multimodal datasets and methods for Music Information Retrieval (MIR) tasks such as genre classification or autotagging. Music can be described at different levels of granularity, for instance defining genres at the level of artists or music albums. However, most datasets for multimodal MIR neglect this aspect and provide data at the level of individual music tracks. We aim to fill this gap by providing Music4All Artist and Album (Music4All A+A), a dataset for multimodal MIR tasks based on music artists and albums. Music4All A+A is built on top of the Music4All-Onion dataset, an existing track-level dataset for MIR tasks. Music4All A+A provides metadata, genre labels, image representations, and textual descriptors for 6,741 artists and 19,511 albums. Furthermore, since Music4All A+A is built on top of Music4All-Onion, it allows access to other multimodal data at the track level, including user--item interaction data. This renders Music4All A+A suitable for a broad range of MIR tasks, including multimodal music recommendation, at several levels of granularity. To showcase the use of Music4All A+A, we carry out experiments on multimodal genre classification of artists and albums, including an analysis in missing-modality scenarios, and a quantitative comparison with genre classification in the movie domain. Our experiments show that images are more informative for classifying the genres of artists and albums, and that several multimodal models for genre classification struggle in generalizing across domains. We provide the code to reproduce our experiments at https://github.com/hcai-mms/Music4All-A-A, the dataset is linked in the repository and provided open-source under a CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.",

It has not been clear how to address this question, the \"subject matter expertise vs. professional manager debate\", quantitatively and objectively. We note that a company's success depends on long sequences of interdependent decisions, with often-opposing recommendations of diverse board members. To model this task in a controlled environment, we utilize chess - a complex, sequential game with interdependent decisions which allows for quantitative analysis of performance and expertise (since the states, actions and game outcomes are well-defined). The availability of chess engines differing in style and expertise, allows scalable experimentation. We considered a team of (computer) chess players. At each turn, team members recommend a move and a manager chooses a recommendation. We compared the performance of two manager types. For manager as \"subject matter expert\", we used another (computer) chess player that assesses the recommendations of the team members based on its own chess expertise. We examined the performance of such managers at different strength levels. To model a \"professional manager\", we used Reinforcement Learning (RL) to train a network that identifies the board positions in which different team members have relative advantage, without any pretraining in chess. We further examined this network to see if any chess knowledge is acquired implicitly. We found that subject matter expertise beyond a minimal threshold does not significantly contribute to team synergy. Moreover, performance of a RL-trained \"professional\" manager significantly exceeds that of even the best \"expert\" managers, while acquiring only limited understanding of chess.",

(2016) adopted a cluster-randomized stepped-wedge design to assess the effect of palliative care on a patient-centered outcome. The randomized intervention was a nudge to administer palliative care but did not guarantee receipt of palliative care, resulting in noncompliance (compliance rate ~30%). A subsequent analysis using methods suited for standard trial designs produced statistically anomalous results, as an intention-to-treat analysis found no effect while an instrumental variable analysis did (Courtright et al., 2024). This highlights the need for a more principled approach to address noncompliance in stepped-wedge designs. We provide a formal causal inference framework for the stepped-wedge design with noncompliance by introducing a relevant causal estimand and corresponding estimators and inferential procedures. Through simulation, we compare an array of estimators across a range of stepped-wedge designs and provide practical guidance in choosing an analysis method. Finally, we apply our recommended methods to reanalyze the trial of Courtright et al. (2016), producing point estimates suggesting a larger effect than the original analysis of (Courtright et al., 2024), but intervals that did not reach statistical significance.",

Inverse design using multi-agent systems (MAS) shows great potential for new material discovery. However, current MAS for materials research rely on predefined configurations and tools, limiting their adaptability and scalability. To address these limitations, we developed a planner driven multi-agent system (S1-MatAgent) which adopts a Planner-Executor architecture. Planner automatically decomposes complex materials design tasks, dynamically configures various tools to generate dedicated Executor agents for each subtask, significantly reducing reliance on manual workflow construction and specialized configuration. Applied to high-entropy alloy catalysts for hydrogen evolution reactions in alkaline conditions, S1-MatAgent completed full-cycle closed-loop design from literature analysis and composition recommendation to performance optimization and experimental validation. To tackle the deviations between designed materials and target, as well as high experimental verification costs, S1-MatAgent employs a novel composition optimization algorithm based on gradients of machine learning interatomic potential, achieving 27.7 % improvement in material performance. S1-MatAgent designed 13 high-performance catalysts from 20 million candidates, with Ni4Co4Cu1Mo3Ru4 exhibiting an overpotential of 18.6 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and maintaining 97.5 % activity after 500 hours at 500 mA cm-2.

While game-theoretic properties can explain why certain teams or agent populations outperform others, more abstract behaviours, such as convention following, are harder to control in training and evaluation settings. The Melting Pot contest is a social AI evaluation suite designed to assess the cooperation capabilities of AI systems. In this paper, we apply a Bayesian approach known as Measurement Layouts to infer the capability profiles of multi-agent systems in the Melting Pot contest. We show that these capability profiles not only predict future performance within the Melting Pot suite but also reveal the underlying prosocial abilities of agents. Our analysis indicates that while higher prosocial capabilities sometimes correlate with better performance, this is not a universal trend-some lower-scoring agents exhibit stronger cooperation abilities. Furthermore, we find that top-performing contest submissions are more likely to achieve high scores in scenarios where prosocial capabilities are not required. These findings, together with reports that the contest winner used a hard-coded solution tailored to specific environments, suggest that at least one top-performing team may have optimised for conditions where cooperation was not necessary, potentially exploiting limitations in the evaluation framework. We provide recommendations for improving the annotation of cooperation demands and propose future research directions to account for biases introduced by different testing environments. Our results demonstrate that Measurement Layouts offer both strong predictive accuracy and actionable insights, contributing to a more transparent and generalisable approach to evaluating AI systems in complex social settings.",

Data privacy concerns also pose a barrier, especially when farmers lack transparency regarding who can access their data and for what purposes.   This paper examines dairy farmers' explainability requirements for technical recommendations and data privacy, along with the influence of socio-demographic factors. Based on a mixed-methods study involving 40 German dairy farmers, we identify five user personas through k-means clustering. Our findings reveal varying requirements, with some farmers preferring little detail while others seek full transparency across different aspects. Age, technology experience, and confidence in using digital systems were found to correlate with these explainability requirements.

            "abstract": "Existing approaches to sample size calculations for developing clinical prediction models have focused on ensuring that the expected value of a chosen performance measure meets a pre-specified target. For example, to limit model-overfitting, the sample size is commonly chosen such that the expected calibration slope (CS) is 0.9, close to 1 for a perfectly calibrated model. In practice, due to sampling variability, model performance can vary considerably across different development samples of the recommended size. If this variability is high, the probability of obtaining a model with performance close to the target for a given measure may be unacceptably low. To address this, we propose an adapted approach to sample size calculations that explicitly incorporates performance variability by targeting the probability of acceptable performance (PrAP). For example, in the context of calibration, we may define a model as acceptably calibrated if CS falls in a pre-defined range, e.g. between 0.85 and 1.15. Then we choose the required sample size to ensure that PrAP(CS)=80%. For binary outcomes we implemented our approach for CS within a simulation-based framework via the R package `samplesizedev'. Additionally, for CS specifically, we have proposed an equivalent analytical calculation which is computationally efficient. While we focused on CS, the simulation-based framework is flexible and can be easily extended to accommodate other performance measures and types of outcomes. When adhering to existing recommendations, we found that performance variability increased substantially as the number of predictors, p, decreased. Consequently, PrAP(CS) was often low. For example, with 5 predictors, PrAP(CS) was around 50%. Our adapted approach resulted in considerably larger sample sizes, especially for p<10. Applying shrinkage tends to improve PrAP(CS).",

However, ensuring the security of the PWA installation lifecycle is essential for maintaining user trust and privacy. This paper introduces the GUARDIANPWA framework, a comprehensive approach to analyzing the PWA installation mechanism based on the CIA security principles (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability) and identifying areas where browser vendors fail to comply with these principles. Our study revealed 203 instances of non-compliance with security principles, highlighting how these irregularities in the PWA installation lifecycle can lead to potential violations of user privacy. For instance, in Firefox, PWAs installed in private mode incorrectly appear in normal mode, risking user confidentiality. Additionally, 29,465 PWAs are at risk because Samsung Internet does not display origins when PWAs navigate to third-party websites, undermining integrity. These findings were reported to browser vendors, leading to Firefox acknowledging four issues, resolving one, and planning to resolve two others. GUARDIANPWA supports developers by analyzing PWA manifest files for syntactic and semantic correctness, offering actionable recommendations, and helping to create PWAs that align with security best practices. By using GUARDIANPWA, developers and users can address critical security gaps and enhance compliance with CIA principles throughout the PWA installation lifecycle.",

            "abstract": "Differential privacy (DP) -- a principled approach to producing statistical data products with strong, mathematically provable privacy guarantees for the individuals in the underlying dataset -- has seen substantial adoption in practice over the past decade. Applying DP requires making several implementation decisions, each with significant impacts on data privacy and/or utility. Hence, to promote shared learning and accountability around DP deployments, Dwork, Kohli, and Mulligan (2019) proposed a public-facing repository (\"registry\") of DP deployments. The DP community has recently started to work toward realizing this vision. We contribute to this effort by (1) developing a holistic, hierarchical schema to describe any given DP deployment and (2) designing and implementing an interactive interface to act as a registry where practitioners can access information about past DP deployments. We (3) populate our interface with 21 real-world DP deployments and (4) conduct an exploratory user study with DP practitioners ($n=16$) to understand how they would use the registry, as well as what challenges and opportunities they foresee around its adoption. We find that participants were enthusiastic about the registry as a valuable resource for evaluating prior deployments and making future deployments. They also identified several opportunities for the registry, including that it can become a \"hub\" for the community and support broader communication around DP (e.g., to legal teams). At the same time, they identified challenges around the registry gaining adoption, including the effort and risk involved with making implementation choices public and moderating the quality of entries. Based on our findings, we offer recommendations for encouraging adoption and increasing the registry's value not only to DP practitioners, but also to policymakers, data users, and data subjects.",

Programmers that are over-trusting may be too reliant on their tools, leading to incorrect or vulnerable code; programmers that are under-trusting may avoid using tools that can improve their productivity and well-being.   Methods. Since trust is a dynamic attitude that may change over time, this study aims to understand programmers' evolution of trust after immediate (one hour) and extended (10 days) use of GitHub Copilot. We collected survey data from 71 upper-division computer science students working on a legacy code base, representing a population that is about to enter the workforce. In this study, we quantitatively measure student trust levels and qualitatively uncover why student trust changes.   Findings. Student trust, on average, increased over time. After completing a project with Copilot, however, students felt that Copilot requires a competent programmer to complete some tasks manually. Students mentioned that seeing Copilot's correctness, understanding how Copilot uses context from the code base, and learning some basics of natural language processing contributed to their elevated trust.   Implications. Our study helps instructors and industry managers understand the factors that influence how students calibrate their trust with AI assistants. We make four pedagogical recommendations, which are that CS educators should 1) provide opportunities for students to work with Copilot on challenging software engineering tasks to calibrate their trust, 2) teach traditional skills of comprehending, debugging, and testing so students can verify output, 3) teach students about the basics of natural language processing, and 4) explicitly introduce and demonstrate the range of features available in Copilot.",

First, the current state of V2G development is examined, highlighting its growing importance in mitigating peak demand, enhancing voltage and frequency regulation, and reinforcing grid resilience. The study underscores the pivotal role of artificial intelligence and machine learning in optimizing energy management, load forecasting, and real-time grid control. A critical analysis of cybersecurity risks reveals heightened vulnerabilities stemming from V2G's dependence on interconnected networks and real-time data exchange, prompting an exploration of advanced mitigation strategies, including federated learning, blockchain, and quantum-resistant cryptography. Furthermore, the paper reviews economic and market aspects, including business models (V2G as an aggregator or due to self-consumption), regulation (as flexibility service provider) and factors influencing user acceptance shaping V2G adoption. Data from global case studies and pilot programs offer a snapshot of how V2G has been implemented at different paces across regions. Finally, the study suggests a multi-layered framework that incorporates grid stability resilience, cybersecurity resiliency, and energy market dynamics and provides strategic recommendations to enable scalable, secure, and economically viable V2G deployment.",

Despite this, the recommender systems community hardly understands, addresses, and evaluates the environmental impact of their work. In this study, we examine the environmental impact of recommender systems research by reproducing typical experimental pipelines. Based on our results, we provide guidelines for researchers and practitioners on how to minimize the environmental footprint of their work and implement green recommender systems - recommender systems designed to minimize their energy consumption and carbon footprint. Our analysis covers 79 papers from the 2013 and 2023 ACM RecSys conferences, comparing traditional \"good old-fashioned AI\" models with modern deep learning models. We designed and reproduced representative experimental pipelines for both years, measuring energy consumption using a hardware energy meter and converting it into CO2 equivalents. Our results show that papers utilizing deep learning models emit approximately 42 times more CO2 equivalents than papers using traditional models. On average, a single deep learning-based paper generates 2,909 kilograms of CO2 equivalents - more than the carbon emissions of a person flying from New York City to Melbourne or the amount of CO2 sequestered by one tree over 260 years. This work underscores the urgent need for the recommender systems and wider machine learning communities to adopt green AI principles, balancing algorithmic advancements and environmental responsibility to build a sustainable future with AI-powered personalization.",

            "abstract": "Pre-ranking plays a crucial role in large-scale recommender systems by significantly improving the efficiency and scalability within the constraints of providing high-quality candidate sets in real time. The two-tower model is widely used in pre-ranking systems due to a good balance between efficiency and effectiveness with decoupled architecture, which independently processes user and item inputs before calculating their interaction (e.g. dot product or similarity measure). However, this independence also leads to the lack of information interaction between the two towers, resulting in less effectiveness. In this paper, a novel architecture named learnable Fully Interacted Two-tower Model (FIT) is proposed, which enables rich information interactions while ensuring inference efficiency. FIT mainly consists of two parts: Meta Query Module (MQM) and Lightweight Similarity Scorer (LSS). Specifically, MQM introduces a learnable item meta matrix to achieve expressive early interaction between user and item features. Moreover, LSS is designed to further obtain effective late interaction between the user and item towers. Finally, experimental results on several public datasets show that our proposed FIT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline pre-ranking models.",

However, existing studies have remained largely in preliminary exploration with a limited understanding of real-world practice, risking a misalignment between academic research and practical needs and hindering the translation of results. To examine and address these potential challenges, we conducted an empirical study of 74 selected papers and 56 public GitHub projects, identified nine task types for LLMs in UAV systems, and quantified their distribution. Our findings show that academic research emphasizes theoretical modeling and task optimization with dispersed attention across tasks. In contrast, industrial projects focus on flight control, task planning, and human-machine interaction, prioritizing operability and efficiency. To further capture industry perspectives, we distributed an online questionnaire. We obtained 52 valid responses: 40.4% of practitioners have attempted to apply LLMs to UAV tasks. We further identify factors that impede real-world integration, including technological maturity, performance, safety, cost, and other considerations.

One emerging field, pathway analysis, is promising but still relies on manually derived wet lab data, which is time-consuming to acquire. This work proposes an efficient, effective end-to-end framework for Artificial Intelligence (AI) based pathway analysis that predicts both cancer severity and mutation progression, thus recommending possible treatments. The proposed technique involves a novel combination of time-series machine learning models and pathway analysis. First, mutation sequences were isolated from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Database. Then, a novel preprocessing algorithm was used to filter key mutations by mutation frequency. This data was fed into a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that predicted cancer severity. Then, the model probabilistically used the RNN predictions, information from the preprocessing algorithm, and multiple drug-target databases to predict future mutations and recommend possible treatments. This framework achieved robust results and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves (a key statistical metric) with accuracies greater than 60%, similar to existing cancer diagnostics. In addition, preprocessing played an instrumental role in isolating important mutations, demonstrating that each cancer stage studied may contain on the order of a few-hundred key driver mutations, consistent with current research. Heatmaps based on predicted gene frequency were also generated, highlighting key mutations in each cancer. Overall, this work is the first to propose an efficient, cost-effective end-to-end framework for projecting cancer progression and providing possible treatments without relying on expensive, time-consuming wet lab work.",

Addressing these gaps, this work poses two central questions: (1) How might we trace the evolution and distillation of ideas into concrete recommendations within deliberative assemblies? (2) How does the deliberative process shape delegate perspectives and influence voting dynamics over the course of the assembly? To address these questions, we develop LLM-based methodologies for empirically analyzing transcripts from a tech-enhanced in-person deliberative assembly. The framework identifies and visualizes the space of expressed suggestions. We also empirically reconstruct each delegate's evolving perspective throughout the assembly. Our methods contribute novel empirical insights into deliberative processes and demonstrate how LLMs can surface high-resolution dynamics otherwise invisible in traditional assembly outputs.",

However, despite significant research advances, state-of-the-art VQ methods still face challenges in balancing encoding efficiency and quantization accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose a novel VQ method called SAQ. To improve accuracy, SAQ employs a new dimension segmentation technique to strategically partition PCA-projected vectors into segments along their dimensions. By prioritizing leading dimension segments with larger magnitudes, SAQ allocates more bits to high-impact segments, optimizing the use of the available space quota. An efficient dynamic programming algorithm is developed to optimize dimension segmentation and bit allocation, ensuring minimal quantization error. To speed up vector encoding, SAQ devises a code adjustment technique to first quantize each dimension independently and then progressively refine quantized vectors using a coordinate-descent-like approach to avoid exhaustive enumeration. Extensive experiments demonstrate SAQ's superiority over classical methods (e.g., PQ, PCA) and recent state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., LVQ, Extended RabitQ). SAQ achieves up to 80% reduction in quantization error and accelerates encoding speed by over 80x compared to Extended RabitQ.",

The early feature selection selects a fixed subset of features and retrains the model, while the late feature selection, known as adaptive feature selection, dynamically adjusts feature choices for each data instance, recognizing the variability in feature significance. Although adaptive feature selection has shown remarkable improvements in performance, its main drawback lies in its post-embedding layer feature selection. This process often becomes cumbersome and inefficient in large-scale recommender systems with billions of ID-type features, leading to a highly sparse and parameter-heavy embedding layer. To overcome this, we introduce Adaptive Early Feature Selection (AEFS), a very simple method that not only adaptively selects informative features for each instance, but also significantly reduces the activated parameters of the embedding layer. AEFS employs a dual-model architecture, encompassing an auxiliary model dedicated to feature selection and a main model responsible for prediction. To ensure effective alignment between these two models, we incorporate two collaborative training loss constraints. Our extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach. Notably, AEFS matches the performance of current state-of-theart Adaptive Late Feature Selection methods while achieving a significant reduction of 37. 5% in the activated parameters of the embedding layer. AEFS is open-source at https://github. com/fly-dragon211/AEFS .",

Although some multimodal reasoning models have emerged for reasoning complex tasks in scientific domains, their applications in the healthcare domain remain limited and fall short in correct reasoning for diagnosis. To address the challenges of multimodal medical reasoning for correct diagnosis and assist the healthcare professionals, a novel temporal graph-based reasoning process modelled through a directed graph has been proposed in the current work. It helps in accommodating dynamic changes in reasons through backtracking, refining the reasoning content, and creating new or deleting existing reasons to reach the best recommendation or answer. Again, consideration of multimodal data at different time points can enable tracking and analysis of patient health and disease progression. Moreover, the proposed multi-agent temporal reasoning framework provides task distributions and a cross-validation mechanism to further enhance the accuracy of reasoning outputs. A few basic experiments and analysis results justify the novelty and practical utility of the proposed preliminary approach.",

In such scenarios, the scale of the data or the scale of the graph may exceed the processing capacity of a single machine. This paper aims to address the graph construction problem of such scale via efficient graph merge. For the graph construction on a single node, two generic and highly parallelizable algorithms, namely Two-way Merge and Multi-way Merge are proposed to merge subgraphs into one. For the graph construction across multiple nodes, a multi-node procedure based on Two-way Merge is presented. The procedure makes it feasible to construct a large-scale k-NN graph/indexing graph on either a single node or multiple nodes when the data size exceeds the memory capacity of one node. Extensive experiments are conducted on both large-scale k-NN graph and indexing graph construction. For the k-NN graph construction, the large-scale and high-quality k-NN graphs are constructed by graph merge in parallel. Typically, a billion-scale k-NN graph can be built in approximately 17h when only three nodes are employed. For the indexing graph construction, similar NN search performance as the original indexing graph is achieved with the merged indexing graphs while requiring much less time of construction.",

Yet, most these systems are still hard to learn and use: Clinicians often face the burden of managing multiple tools, repeating manual actions for each patient, navigating complicated UI trees to locate functions, and spending significant time on administration instead of caring for patients. The recent rise of large language model (LLM) based agents demonstrates exceptional capability in coding and computer operation, revealing the potential for humans to interact with operating systems and software not by direct manipulation, but by instructing agents through natural language. This shift highlights the need for an abstraction layer, an agent-computer interface, that translates human language into machine-executable commands. In digital healthcare, however, requires a more domain-specific abstractions that strictly follow trusted clinical guidelines and procedural standards to ensure safety, transparency, and compliance. To address this need, we present \\textbf{MedicalOS}, a unified agent-based operational system designed as such a domain-specific abstract layer for healthcare. It translates human instructions into pre-defined digital healthcare commands, such as patient inquiry, history retrieval, exam management, report generation, referrals, treatment planning, that we wrapped as off-the-shelf tools using machine languages (e.g., Python, APIs, MCP, Linux). We empirically validate MedicalOS on 214 patient cases across 22 specialties, demonstrating high diagnostic accuracy and confidence, clinically sound examination requests, and consistent generation of structured reports and medication recommendations. These results highlight MedicalOS as a trustworthy and scalable foundation for advancing workflow automation in clinical practice.",

We breakdown the significance of each approach and ground it in use cases relevant to life sciences, from literature summarization and data extraction to editorial tasks. We provide detailed recommendations for how prompts should and shouldn't be structured, addressing common pitfalls including multi-turn conversation degradation, hallucinations, and distinctions between reasoning and non-reasoning models. We examine context window limitations, agentic tools like Claude Code, while analyzing the effectiveness of Deep Research tools across OpenAI, Google, Anthropic and Perplexity platforms, discussing current limitations.

This paradigm allows each client (e.g., an individual online store) to train a recommendation model locally while sharing only model updates, without exposing the raw interaction logs to a central server, thereby preserving privacy in a decentralized environment. Nonetheless, most existing FL-based recommender systems still rely solely on each client's private data, despite the abundance of publicly available datasets that could be leveraged to enrich local training; this potential remains largely underexplored. To this end, we consider a realistic scenario wherein a large shopping platform collaborates with multiple small online stores to build a global recommender system. The platform possesses global data, such as shareable user and item lists, while each store holds a portion of interaction data privately (or locally). Although integrating global data can help mitigate the limitations of sparse and biased clients' local data, it also introduces additional challenges: simply combining all global interactions can amplify noise and irrelevant patterns, worsening personalization and increasing computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose FedGDVE, which selectively augments each client's local graph with semantically aligned samples from the global dataset. FedGDVE employs: (i) a pre-trained graph encoder to extract global structural features, (ii) a local valid predictor to assess client-specific relevance, (iii) a reinforcement-learning-based probability estimator to filter and sample only the most pertinent global interactions. FedGDVE improves performance by up to 34.86% on recognized benchmarks in FL environments.",

Existing methods struggle with sparse data, incomplete routes, and limited modeling of complex spatial dependencies, often relying on low-level check-in data or ignoring spatial patterns. In this paper, we introduced GCN-TULHOR, a method that transforms raw location data into higher-order mobility flow representations using hexagonal tessellation, reducing data sparsity and capturing richer spatial semantics, and integrating Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). Our approach converts both sparse check-in and continuous GPS trajectory data into unified higher-order flow representations, mitigating sparsity while capturing deeper semantic information. The GCN layer explicitly models complex spatial relationships and non-local dependencies without requiring side information such as timestamps or points of interest. Experiments on six real-world datasets show consistent improvements over classical baselines, RNN- and Transformer-based models, and the TULHOR method in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. GCN-TULHOR achieves 1-8% relative gains in accuracy and F1. Sensitivity analysis identifies an optimal setup with a single GCN layer and 512-dimensional embeddings. The integration of GCNs enhances spatial learning and improves generalizability across mobility data. This work highlights the value of combining graph-based spatial learning with sequential modeling, offering a robust and scalable solution for TUL with applications in recommendations, urban planning, and security.",

            "abstract": "Recommender systems (RecSys) have been widely applied to various applications, including E-commerce, finance, healthcare, social media and have become increasingly influential in shaping user behavior and decision-making, highlighting their growing impact in various domains. However, recent studies have shown that RecSys are vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to infer whether user interaction record was used to train a target model or not. MIAs on RecSys models can directly lead to a privacy breach. For example, via identifying the fact that a purchase record that has been used to train a RecSys associated with a specific user, an attacker can infer that user's special quirks. In recent years, MIAs have been shown to be effective on other ML tasks, e.g., classification models and natural language processing. However, traditional MIAs are ill-suited for RecSys due to the unseen posterior probability. Although MIAs on RecSys form a newly emerging and rapidly growing research area, there has been no systematic survey on this topic yet. In this article, we conduct the first comprehensive survey on RecSys MIAs. This survey offers a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in RecSys MIAs, exploring the design principles, challenges, attack and defense associated with this emerging field. We provide a unified taxonomy that categorizes different RecSys MIAs based on their characterizations and discuss their pros and cons. Based on the limitations and gaps identified in this survey, we point out several promising future research directions to inspire the researchers who wish to follow this area. This survey not only serves as a reference for the research community but also provides a clear description for researchers outside this research domain.",

The \"no free lunch\" theorem highlights that no single algorithm performs optimally across all problems. While online adaptation methods have been proposed, they often suffer from inefficiency, weak convergence, and limited generalization on constrained optimization problems (COPs).   To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework for automated component configuration in Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm to address COPs, powered by Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Specifically, we propose SuperDE, a foundation model that dynamically configures DE's evolutionary components based on real-time evolution. Trained offline through meta-learning across a wide variety of COPs, SuperDE is capable of recommending optimal per-generation configurations for unseen problems in a zero-shot manner. Utilizing a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN), SuperDE adapts its configuration strategies in response to the evolving population states during optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that SuperDE significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms on benchmark test suites, achieving superior generalization and optimization performance.",

We propose a learning framework that learns an approximate correlated equilibrium by actively querying players' regrets, \\emph{i.e.}, the cost saved by deviating from the coordinator's recommendations. We first show that a correlated equilibrium in convex games corresponds to a joint action distribution over an infinite joint action space that minimizes all players' regrets. To make the learning problem tractable, we introduce a heuristic that selects finitely many representative joint actions by maximizing their pairwise differences. We then apply Bayesian optimization to learn a probability distribution over the selected joint actions by querying all players' regrets. The learned distribution approximates a correlated equilibrium by minimizing players' regrets. We demonstrate the proposed approach via numerical experiments on multi-user traffic assignment games in a shared transportation network.",

We curate a multi-source benchmark drawing from Cochrane systematic reviews and clinical guidelines, including structured recommendations from the American Heart Association and narrative guidance used by insurers. Using GPT-4o-mini and GPT-5, we observe consistent performance patterns across sources and clinical domains: accuracy is highest on structured guideline recommendations (90%) and lower on narrative guideline and systematic review questions (60--70%). We also find a strong correlation between accuracy and the citation count of the underlying systematic reviews, where each doubling of citations is associated with roughly a 30% increase in the odds of a correct answer. Models show moderate ability to reason about evidence quality when contextual information is supplied. When we incorporate retrieval-augmented prompting, providing the gold-source abstract raises accuracy on previously incorrect items to 0.79; providing top 3 PubMed abstracts (ranked by semantic relevance) improves accuracy to 0.23, while random abstracts reduce accuracy (0.10, within temperature variation). These effects are mirrored in GPT-4o-mini, underscoring that source clarity and targeted retrieval -- not just model size -- drive performance. Overall, our results highlight both the promise and current limitations of LLMs for evidence-based clinical question answering. Retrieval-augmented prompting emerges as a useful strategy to improve factual accuracy and alignment with source evidence, while stratified evaluation by specialty and question type remains essential to understand current knowledge access and to contextualize model performance.",

Here, we systematically investigate several variants of RPSH in the frameworks of centroid and bead approximations (RPSH-CA and RPSH-BA) in modeling the dynamics of the spin-boson system across different reaction regimes, reorganization energies, and temperatures. Moreover, the effects of including the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction (DBOC) on the performance of the RPSH-CA and RPSH-BA methods are investigated. Our results show that the RPSH-CA method, where non-adiabatic transitions are handled at the centroid level, reliably captures NQEs and remains robust across different reaction regimes. Adding DBOC improves the method's accuracy in specific intermediate and non-adiabatic reaction regimes at low temperature. Conversely, adding DBOC to the conventional fewest-switches surface hopping method was found to over-damp the dynamics significantly and reduce accuracy, especially at low temperatures. On the other hand, RPSH-BA results, where non-adiabatic transitions are handled at the level of individual beads of the ring polymers, are generally unreliable unless in the adiabatic reaction regime and at high temperature. The inclusion of DBOC is not particularly helpful in remedying this erratic behavior. As such, RPSH-BA is not recommended for including NQEs in condensed-phase non-adiabatic dynamics simulations despite its early successful reports in 1D scattering models. Our findings clarify when geometric corrections are beneficial or detrimental to non-adiabatic simulations using RPSH, providing practical guidance for atomistic condensed-phase applications.",

While resistive random access memory (ReRAM) based crossbars offer a fast and energy-efficient solution through in-memory embedding reduction operations, naively mapping embeddings onto crossbar arrays leads to poor crossbar utilization and thus degrades performance. We present ReCross, an efficient ReRAM-based in-memory computing (IMC) scheme designed to minimize execution time and enhance energy efficiency in DLRM embedding reduction. ReCross co-optimizes embedding access patterns and ReRAM crossbar characteristics by intelligently grouping and mapping co-occurring embeddings, replicating frequently accessed embeddings across crossbars, and dynamically selecting in-memory processing operations using a newly designed dynamic switch ADC circuit that considers runtime energy trade-offs. Experimental results demonstrate that ReCross achieves a 3.97x reduction in execution time and a 6.1x improvement in energy efficiency compared to state-of-the-art IMC approaches.",

RecoWorld distinguishes itself with a dual-view architecture: a simulated user and an agentic recommender engage in multi-turn interactions aimed at maximizing user retention. The user simulator reviews recommended items, updates its mindset, and when sensing potential user disengagement, generates reflective instructions. The agentic recommender adapts its recommendations by incorporating these user instructions and reasoning traces, creating a dynamic feedback loop that actively engages users. This process leverages the exceptional reasoning capabilities of modern LLMs. We explore diverse content representations within the simulator, including text-based, multimodal, and semantic ID modeling, and discuss how multi-turn RL enables the recommender to refine its strategies through iterative interactions. RecoWorld also supports multi-agent simulations, allowing creators to simulate the responses of targeted user populations.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive characterization of LLM training across diverse real-world workloads and hardware platforms, including NVIDIA H100/H200 and AMD MI250 GPUs. We analyze dense and sparse models under various parallelism strategies -- tensor, pipeline, data, and expert -- and evaluate their effects on hardware utilization, power consumption, and thermal behavior. We further evaluate the effectiveness of optimizations such as activation recomputation and compute-communication overlap. Our findings show that performance is not determined solely by scaling hardware capacity. Scale-up systems with fewer, higher-memory GPUs can outperform scale-out systems in communication-bound regimes, but only under carefully tuned configurations; in other cases, scale-out deployments achieve superior throughput. We also show that certain parallelism combinations, such as tensor with pipeline, lead to bandwidth underutilization due to inefficient data chunking, while increasing microbatch sizes beyond a certain point induces bursty execution and peak power excursions that worsen thermal throttling. These insights reveal how training performance is shaped by complex interactions between hardware, system topology, and model execution. We conclude by offering recommendations for system and hardware design to improve the scalability and reliability of future LLM systems and workloads.

            "abstract": "Ionic liquids (ILs) have emerged as versatile replacements for traditional solvents because their physicochemical properties can be precisely tailored to various applications. However, accurately predicting key thermophysical properties remains challenging due to the vast chemical design space and the limited availability of experimental data. In this study, we present a data-driven transfer learning framework that leverages a neural recommender system (NRS) to enable reliable property prediction for ILs using sparse experimental datasets. The approach involves a two-stage process: first, pre-training NRS models on COSMO-RS-based simulated data at fixed temperature and pressure to learn property-specific structural embeddings for cations and anions; and second, fine-tuning simple feedforward neural networks using these embeddings with experimental data at varying temperatures and pressures. In this work, five essential IL properties are considered: density, viscosity, surface tension, heat capacity, and melting point. The framework supports both within-property and cross-property knowledge transfer. Notably, pre-trained models for density, viscosity, and heat capacity are used to fine-tune models for all five target properties, achieving improved performance by a substantial margin for four of them. The model exhibits robust extrapolation to previously unseen ILs. Moreover, the final trained models enable property prediction for over 700,000 IL combinations, offering a scalable solution for IL screening in process design. This work highlights the effectiveness of combining simulated data and transfer learning to overcome sparsity in the experimental data.",

However, these methods frequently reduce the interpretability and transparency of the system. In this research, we develop a systematic application, adaptation, and evaluation of deletion diagnostics in the recommender setting. The method compares the performance of a model to that of a similar model trained without a specific user or item, allowing us to quantify how that observation influences the recommender, either positively or negatively. To demonstrate its model-agnostic nature, the proposal is applied to both Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF), a widely used deep learning-based recommender, and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), a classical collaborative filtering technique. Experiments on the MovieLens and Amazon Reviews datasets provide insights into model behavior and highlight the generality of the approach across different recommendation paradigms.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the problem of computing the integral of a function on the unit sphere, in any dimension, using Monte Carlo methods. Although the methods we present are general, our guiding thread is the sliced Wasserstein distance between two measures on $\\mathbb{R}^d$, which is precisely an integral on the $d$-dimensional sphere. The sliced Wasserstein distance (SW) has gained momentum in machine learning either as a proxy to the less computationally tractable Wasserstein distance, or as a distance in its own right, due in particular to its built-in alleviation of the curse of dimensionality. There has been recent numerical benchmarks of quadratures for the sliced Wasserstein, and our viewpoint differs in that we concentrate on quadratures where the nodes are repulsive, i.e. negatively dependent. Indeed, negative dependence can bring variance reduction when the quadrature is adapted to the integration task. Our first contribution is to extract and motivate quadratures from the recent literature on determinantal point processes (DPPs) and repelled point processes, as well as repulsive quadratures from the literature specific to the sliced Wasserstein distance. We then numerically benchmark these quadratures. Moreover, we analyze the variance of the UnifOrtho estimator, an orthogonal Monte Carlo estimator. Our analysis sheds light on UnifOrtho's success for the estimation of the sliced Wasserstein in large dimensions, as well as counterexamples from the literature. Our final recommendation for the computation of the sliced Wasserstein distance is to use randomized quasi-Monte Carlo in low dimensions and \\emph{UnifOrtho} in large dimensions. DPP-based quadratures only shine when quasi-Monte Carlo also does, while repelled quadratures show moderate variance reduction in general, but more theoretical effort is needed to make them robust.",

Existing methods often lack the ability to provide accurate, real-time medical advice, particularly for irregular inputs and underrepresented languages. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes an approach that fine-tunes large language models (LLMs) for Arabic medical text generation. The system is designed to assist patients by providing accurate medical advice, diagnoses, drug recommendations, and treatment plans based on user input. The research methodology required the collection of a unique dataset from social media platforms, capturing real-world medical conversations between patients and doctors. The dataset, which includes patient complaints together with medical advice, was properly cleaned and preprocessed to account for multiple Arabic dialects. Fine-tuning state-of-the-art generative models, such as Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, LLaMA-2-7B, and GPT-2 Medium, optimized the system's ability to generate reliable medical text. Results from evaluations indicate that the fine-tuned Mistral-7B model outperformed the other models, achieving average BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) Score values in precision, recall, and F1-scores of 68.5\\%, 69.08\\%, and 68.5\\%, respectively. Comparative benchmarking and qualitative assessments validate the system's ability to produce coherent and relevant medical replies to informal input. This study highlights the potential of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in advancing HMS, offering a scalable and adaptable solution for global healthcare challenges, especially in linguistically and culturally diverse environments.",

In this study, we examine to what extent Twitter's content recommender, in conjunction with a user's social network, impacts the topic, political skew, and reliability of information served on the platform during a high-stakes election. We utilize automated accounts to document Twitter's algorithmically curated and reverse chronological timelines throughout the U.S. 2022 midterm election. We find that the algorithmic timeline measurably influences exposure to election content, partisan skew, and the prevalence of low-quality information and election rumors. Critically, these impacts are mediated by the partisan makeup of one's personal social network, which often exerts greater influence than the algorithm alone. We find that the algorithmic feed decreases the proportion of election content shown to left-leaning accounts, and that it skews content toward right-leaning sources when compared to the reverse chronological feed. We additionally find evidence that the algorithmic system increases the prevalence of election-related rumors for right-leaning accounts, and has mixed effects on the prevalence of low-quality information sources. Our work provides insight into the outcomes of Twitter's complex recommender system at a crucial time period before controversial changes to the platform and in the midst of nationwide elections and highlights the need for ongoing study of algorithmic systems and their role in democratic processes.",

We present a Hybrid Adaptive Conformal Offline Reinforcement Learning (HACO) framework that separates risk calibration from preference optimization to generate conservative action recommendations at scale. In our setting, each step involves choosing among common coordination actions (e.g., which member to contact, by which modality, and whether to route to a specialized service) while controlling the near-term risk of adverse utilization events (e.g., unplanned emergency department visits or hospitalizations). Using a de-identified operational dataset from Waymark comprising 2.77 million sequential decisions across 168,126 patients, HACO (i) trains a lightweight risk model for adverse events, (ii) derives a conformal threshold to mask unsafe actions at a target risk level, and (iii) learns a preference policy on the resulting safe subset. We evaluate policies with a version-agnostic fitted Q evaluation (FQE) on stratified subsets and audit subgroup performance across age, sex, and race. HACO achieves strong risk discrimination (AUC ~0.81) with a calibrated threshold ( {\\tau} ~0.038 at {\\alpha} = 0.10), while maintaining high safe coverage. Subgroup analyses reveal systematic differences in estimated value across demographics, underscoring the importance of fairness auditing. Our results show that conformal risk gating integrates cleanly with offline RL to deliver conservative, auditable decision support for population health management teams.",

In this study, we investigate STR in the context of job title matching - a key challenge in resume recommendation systems, where overlapping terms are often limited or misleading. We introduce a self-supervised hybrid architecture that combines dense sentence embeddings with domain-specific Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to improve both semantic alignment and explainability. Unlike previous work that evaluated models on aggregate performance, our approach emphasizes data stratification by partitioning the STR score continuum into distinct regions: low, medium, and high semantic relatedness. This stratified evaluation enables a fine-grained analysis of model performance across semantically meaningful subspaces. We evaluate several embedding models, both with and without KG integration via graph neural networks. The results show that fine-tuned SBERT models augmented with KGs produce consistent improvements in the high-STR region, where the RMSE is reduced by 25% over strong baselines. Our findings highlight not only the benefits of combining KGs with text embeddings, but also the importance of regional performance analysis in understanding model behavior. This granular approach reveals strengths and weaknesses hidden by global metrics, and supports more targeted model selection for use in Human Resources (HR) systems and applications where fairness, explainability, and contextual matching are essential.",

This paper introduces a precise definition and a detailed typology of telecommunications AI incidents, establishing them as a distinct category of risk that extends beyond conventional cybersecurity and data protection breaches. It argues for their recognition as a distinct regulatory concern. Using India as a case study for jurisdictions that lack a horizontal AI law, the paper analyzes the country's key digital regulations. The analysis reveals that India's existing legal instruments, including the Telecommunications Act, 2023, the CERT-In Rules, and the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, focus on cybersecurity and data breaches, creating a significant regulatory gap for AI-specific operational incidents, such as performance degradation and algorithmic bias. The paper also examines structural barriers to disclosure and the limitations of existing AI incident repositories. Based on these findings, the paper proposes targeted policy recommendations centered on integrating AI incident reporting into India's existing telecom governance. Key proposals include mandating reporting for high-risk AI failures, designating an existing government body as a nodal agency to manage incident data, and developing standardized reporting frameworks. These recommendations aim to enhance regulatory clarity and strengthen long-term resilience, offering a pragmatic and replicable blueprint for other nations seeking to govern AI risks within their existing sectoral frameworks.",

This paper revisits Amatriain's diagnosis and argues that many of the conceptual, epistemological, and infrastructural failures he identified still persist, in more subtle or systemic forms.

We highlight ongoing community-led initiatives that attempt to shift the paradigm, including workshops, evaluation frameworks, and calls for value-sensitive and participatory research. At the same time, we contend that meaningful change will require not only new metrics or better tooling, but a fundamental reframing of what recommender systems research is for, who it serves, and how knowledge is produced and validated. Our call is not just for technical reform, but for a recommender systems research agenda grounded in epistemic humility, human impact, and sustainable practice.",

In this work, we first evaluate the performance of CodeBERT for detecting vulnerable functions in industrial and open-source software. We analyse its cross-domain generalisation when fine-tuned on open-source data and tested on industrial data, and vice versa, also exploring strategies for handling class imbalance. Based on these results, we develop AI-DO(Automating vulnerability detection Integration for Developers' Operations), a Continuous Integration-Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)-integrated recommender system that uses fine-tuned CodeBERT to detect and localise vulnerabilities during code review without disrupting workflows. Finally, we assess the tool's perceived usefulness through a survey with the company's IT professionals.

Our findings indicate that participants are generally concerned about privacy when they know what inferences can be made based on the collected data. Despite the more prominent use of smartphones in daily life than augmented reality glasses, we found no indications of differing privacy concerns depending on the device type. In addition, our participants are more comfortable when a particular use case benefits them and less comfortable when other humans can consume their data.

            "abstract": "The question-answering (QA) simulator is a model that mimics real student learning behaviors and predicts their correctness of their responses to questions. QA simulators enable educational recommender systems (ERS) to collect large amounts of training data without interacting with real students, thereby preventing harmful recommendations made by an undertrained ERS from undermining actual student learning. Given the QA history, there are two categories of solutions to predict the correctness, conducting the simulation: (1) LLM-free methods, which apply a traditional sequential model to transfer the QA history into a vector representation first, and make predictions based on the representation; (2) LLM-based methods, which leverage the domain knowledge and reasoning capability of LLM to enhence the prediction. LLM-free methods offer fast inference but generally yield suboptimal performance. In contrast, most LLM-based methods achieve better results, but at the cost of slower inference speed and higher GPU memory consumption. In this paper, we propose a method named LLM Distillation based Simulator (LDSim), which distills domain knowledge and reasoning capability from an LLM to better assist prediction, thereby improving simulation performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LDSim achieves strong results on both the simulation task and the knowledge tracing (KT) task.

            "abstract": "Software developers face risks of leaking their software secrets, such as API keys or passwords, which can result in significant harm. Secret management tools (SMTs), such as HashiCorp Vault Secrets or Infisical, are highly recommended by industry, academia, and security guidelines to manage secrets securely. SMTs are designed to help developers secure their secrets in a central location, yet secrets leaks are still commonplace, and developers report difficulty in learning how to setup and use SMTs. While SMTs typically come with publicly available help resources (e.g., tool documentation and interfaces), it is unclear if these actually help developers learn to effectively use SMTs. Without usable help resources that onboards developers, quick adoption and effective use of SMTs may be unrealistic. In a qualitative two-step study, we observed 21 new users in person while they used SMTs to perform two secret management tasks: secret storage and access, then secret injection. We interviewed participants after each task to identify their challenges and experiences using SMTs, with the assistance of help resources. While our study sample is narrow, it serves as a reasonable proxy for new developers who are likely to adopt SMTs early in their careers. We found that even in a laboratory setting where new users found tool functionality, interface flexibility helpful, they still experienced increased difficulty to effectively use SMTs to securely remediate a hard-coded secret when they felt tool documentation was insufficient and it motivated participants to deviate from official tool documentation to access secondary sources or attempt workaround methods. Specific challenges reported by participants were tool documentation content quality, navigation difficulties with both tool documentation and web interfaces for finding helpful content, and supportive tool features.",

To participate in these groups, members often share sensitive personal information such as photos, addresses, and phone numbers, which exposes them to risks such as fraud, blackmail, and identity theft. To better protect users of Facebook matrimony groups, we need to understand aspects related to user safety, such as how users perceive risks, what influences their trust in sharing personal information, and how they navigate security and privacy concerns when seeking potential partners online. In this study, through 23 semi-structured interviews, we explore how Pakistani users of Facebook matrimony groups perceive and navigate risks of sharing personal information, and how cultural norms and expectations influence their behavior in these groups.   We find elevated privacy concerns among participants, leading them to share limited personal information and creating mistrust among potential partners. Many also expressed concerns about the authenticity of profiles and major security risks, such as identity theft, harassment, and social judgment. Our work highlights the challenges of safely navigating Facebook matrimony groups in Pakistan and offers recommendations for such as implementing stronger identity verification by group admins, enforcing stricter cybersecurity laws, clear platform guidelines to ensure accountability, and technical feature enhancements -- including restricting screenshots, picture downloads, and implementing anonymous chats -- to protect user data and build trust.",

However, the internal workflow of these systems have not been closely examined. This lack of scrutiny poses a risk of introducing flaws that could undermine the integrity, reliability, and trustworthiness of their research outputs. In this paper, we identify four potential failure modes in contemporary AI scientist systems: inappropriate benchmark selection, data leakage, metric misuse, and post-hoc selection bias. To examine these risks, we design controlled experiments that isolate each failure mode while addressing challenges unique to evaluating AI scientist systems. Our assessment of two prominent open-source AI scientist systems reveals the presence of several failures, across a spectrum of severity, which can be easily overlooked in practice. Finally, we demonstrate that access to trace logs and code from the full automated workflow enables far more effective detection of such failures than examining the final paper alone. We thus recommend journals and conferences evaluating AI-generated research to mandate submission of these artifacts alongside the paper to ensure transparency, accountability, and reproducibility.",

To date, LLMs have been widely applied to tasks such as diagnostic assistance, medical question answering, and clinical information synthesis. However, a key open question remains: to what extent do LLMs memorize medical training data. In this study, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of memorization of LLMs in medicine, assessing its prevalence (how frequently it occurs), characteristics (what is memorized), volume (how much content is memorized), and potential downstream impacts (how memorization may affect medical applications). We systematically analyze common adaptation scenarios: (1) continued pretraining on medical corpora, (2) fine-tuning on standard medical benchmarks, and (3) fine-tuning on real-world clinical data, including over 13,000 unique inpatient records from Yale New Haven Health System. The results demonstrate that memorization is prevalent across all adaptation scenarios and significantly higher than reported in the general domain. Memorization affects both the development and adoption of LLMs in medicine and can be categorized into three types: beneficial (e.g., accurate recall of clinical guidelines and biomedical references), uninformative (e.g., repeated disclaimers or templated medical document language), and harmful (e.g., regeneration of dataset-specific or sensitive clinical content). Based on these findings, we offer practical recommendations to facilitate beneficial memorization that enhances domain-specific reasoning and factual accuracy, minimize uninformative memorization to promote deeper learning beyond surface-level patterns, and mitigate harmful memorization to prevent the leakage of sensitive or identifiable patient information.",

We evaluate performance in both low-dimensional settings, representing simple pulse shapes used in current optimal control protocols with a limited number of parameters, and high-dimensional regimes, which reflect the demands of complex control pulses with many parameters.

Hence, there is a need to dive deeper into how we select the optimizers we use for training and the metrics that determine this selection. In this work, we compare the performance of 10 different optimizers in training a simple Multi-layer Perceptron model using a heart disease dataset from Kaggle. We set up a consistent training paradigm and evaluate the optimizers based on metrics such as convergence speed and stability. We also include some other Machine Learning Evaluation metrics such as AUC, Precision, and Recall, which are central metrics to classification problems. Our results show that there are trade-offs between convergence speed and stability, as optimizers like Adagrad and Adadelta, which are more stable, took longer time to converge. Across all our metrics, we chose RMSProp to be the most effective optimizer for this heart disease prediction task because it offered a balanced performance across key metrics. It achieved a precision of 0.765, a recall of 0.827, and an AUC of 0.841, along with faster training time. However, it was not the most stable. We recommend that, in less compute-constrained environments, this method of choosing optimizers through a thorough evaluation should be adopted to increase the scientific nature and performance in training deep learning models.",

In this study, we use the CHGNet uMLIP to model thermal disorder in isostructural layered 2Hc-WS2 and 2Hc-MoS2, benchmarking it against ab initio data and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra, which capture thermal variations in bond lengths and angles. Fine-tuning CHGNet with compound-specific ab initio (DFT) data mitigates the systematic softening (i.e., force underestimation) typical of uMLIPs and simultaneously improves alignment between molecular dynamics-derived and experimental EXAFS spectra. While fine-tuning with a single DFT structure is viable, using ~100 structures is recommended to accurately reproduce EXAFS spectra and achieve DFT-level accuracy. Benchmarking the CHGNet uMLIP against both DFT and experimental EXAFS data reinforces confidence in its performance and provides guidance for determining optimal fine-tuning dataset sizes.",

In this study, we utilize a predictive maintenance approach based on the reliability of a railcar. In particular, we propose a stochastic programming model, in which railcar failure scenarios are generated from a Weibull distribution, a common assumption in the reliability literature. The model incorporates both SLA and track-capacity considerations and is solved through the Sample Average Approximation (SAA) method. We generate random instances to compare the stochastic model and a deterministic model adopted from the literature with respect to several system parameters. Our results show that the stochastic model achieves lower total costs, fewer SLA violations, and a reduced number of corrective interventions compared with deterministic approaches, while effectively managing track-capacity constraints.

A locally deployed DeepSeek-R1 LLM is integrated with an automatic planning algorithm in an iterative loop. Starting with fixed weights, the LLM evaluates plan quality and recommends new weights in the next iteration. This process continues until convergence criteria are met, after which the LLM conducts a comprehensive evaluation to identify the optimal plan. A clinical knowledge base, constructed and queried via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), enhances the model's domain-specific reasoning. The proposed method was validated on 23 patient cases, showing that the LLM-assisted approach produces plans that are comparable to or exceeding clinically approved and fixed-weight plans, in terms of dose homogeneity for the clinical target volume (CTV) and sparing of organs at risk (OARs).

            "abstract": "Code generation has emerged as a pivotal capability of Large Language Models(LLMs), revolutionizing development efficiency for programmers of all skill levels. However, the complexity of data structures and algorithmic logic often results in functional deficiencies and security vulnerabilities in generated code, reducing it to a prototype requiring extensive manual debugging. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can enhance correctness and security by leveraging external code manuals, it simultaneously introduces new attack surfaces.   In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of attack surfaces in Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG), focusing on malicious dependency hijacking. We demonstrate how poisoned documentation containing hidden malicious dependencies (e.g., matplotlib_safe) can subvert RACG, exploiting dual trust chains: LLM reliance on RAG and developers' blind trust in LLM suggestions. To construct poisoned documents, we propose ImportSnare, a novel attack framework employing two synergistic strategies: 1)Position-aware beam search optimizes hidden ranking sequences to elevate poisoned documents in retrieval results, and 2)Multilingual inductive suggestions generate jailbreaking sequences to manipulate LLMs into recommending malicious dependencies. Through extensive experiments across Python, Rust, and JavaScript, ImportSnare achieves significant attack success rates (over 50% for popular libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn) in general, and is also able to succeed even when the poisoning ratio is as low as 0.01%, targeting both custom and real-world malicious packages. Our findings reveal critical supply chain risks in LLM-powered development, highlighting inadequate security alignment for code generation tasks. To support future research, we will release the multilingual benchmark suite and datasets. The project homepage is https://importsnare.github.io.",

However, as these benchmarks often contain spurious correlations between gender and non-gender features, such as objects and backgrounds, we identify a critical oversight in gender bias evaluation: Do spurious features distort gender bias evaluation? To address this question, we systematically perturb non-gender features across four widely used benchmarks (COCO-gender, FACET, MIAP, and PHASE) and various VLMs to quantify their impact on bias evaluation. Our findings reveal that even minimal perturbations, such as masking just 10% of objects or weakly blurring backgrounds, can dramatically alter bias scores, shifting metrics by up to 175% in generative VLMs and 43% in CLIP variants. This suggests that current bias evaluations often reflect model responses to spurious features rather than gender bias, undermining their reliability. Since creating spurious feature-free benchmarks is fundamentally challenging, we recommend reporting bias metrics alongside feature-sensitivity measurements to enable a more reliable bias assessment.",

Firstly, our model has the flexibility to learn a set of associations and combinations between different interaction types in a way that carries over to each user and item. Secondly, our model is able to learn jointly from both the explicit ratings and the implicit information in the sampling pattern (which we refer to as `implicit feedback'). It can also make separate predictions for the probability of consuming content and the likelihood of granting it a high rating if observed. This not only allows the model to make predictions for both the implicit and explicit feedback, but also increases the informativeness of the predictions: in particular, our model can identify items which users would not have been likely to consume naturally, but would be likely to enjoy if exposed to them. Finally, we provide several generalization bounds for our model, which to the best of our knowledge, are among the first generalization bounds for auto-encoders in a Recommender Systems setting; we also show that optimizing our loss function guarantees the recovery of the exact sampling distribution over interactions up to a small error in total variation. In experiments on several real-life datasets, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on both the implicit and explicit feedback prediction tasks despite relying on a single model for both, and benefiting from additional interpretability in the form of individual predictions for the probabilities of each possible rating.",

Translating complex patient presentations into guideline-compliant treatment recommendations is time-intensive, requires specialized expertise, and is prone to error. Advances in large language model (LLM) capabilities promise to reduce the time required to generate treatment recommendations and improve accuracy. We present an LLM agent-based approach to automatically generate guideline-concordant treatment trajectories for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our contributions are threefold. First, we construct a novel longitudinal dataset of 121 cases of NSCLC patients that includes clinical encounters, diagnostic results, and medical histories, each expertly annotated with the corresponding NCCN guideline trajectories by board-certified oncologists. Second, we demonstrate that existing LLMs possess domain-specific knowledge that enables high-quality proxy benchmark generation for both model development and evaluation, achieving strong correlation (Spearman coefficient r=0.88, RMSE = 0.08) with expert-annotated benchmarks. Third, we develop a hybrid approach combining expensive human annotations with model consistency information to create both the agent framework that predicts the relevant guidelines for a patient, as well as a meta-classifier that verifies prediction accuracy with calibrated confidence scores for treatment recommendations (AUROC=0.800), a critical capability for communicating the accuracy of outputs, custom-tailoring tradeoffs in performance, and supporting regulatory compliance. This work establishes a framework for clinically viable LLM-based guideline adherence systems that balance accuracy, interpretability, and regulatory requirements while reducing annotation costs, providing a scalable pathway toward automated clinical decision support.",

State-of-the-art approaches often accomplish this with hierarchical Bayesian inference. However, this typically relies on Monte Carlo approximations that are already very expensive in current data, and may become prohibitively so in the future. In this paper we show how this process can be understood from a first-principles statistical approach. We derive an error estimator $\\hat{E}$ for quantifying the amount of information that is lost due to the Monte Carlo approximation and recommend that this error is limited to no more than $\\hat{E} \\lesssim 0.2$ bits for reliable inference. We also show that the hierarchical likelihood estimator is biased but may be corrected. Finally, we show some practical examples for inference on synthetic gravitational-wave population inference, demonstrating that simple models with strong assumptions can be much more stable to Monte Carlo uncertainty than those with weaker assumptions. We also provide a \\texttt{pip}-installable package \\texttt{population-error} with which analysts can calculate the error statistics $\\hat{E}$.",

First, we report the measurements of an on-sky test of the throughput of the L/M vector vortex coronagraph. We quantify the throughput and additional background flux penalties, noting that the performance effects of using the vector vortex coronagraph in the Ms-filter are greater than in the Lp-filter. Second, we utilize the recently commissioned NIRC2 electronics upgrade to measure the sky variability at sub-second speeds. We find that the background varies at timescales of less than 30s, indicating that the electronics upgrade may open an opportunity to improve the sky-background subtraction of future surveys. Third, we document the contribution of the image derotator to the spatial non-uniformity in the background flux.

Although smaller in scale when compared to historical breaches involving billions of records, Signalgate illustrates critical systemic issues often overshadowed by a focus on external cyber threats. Employing a case-study approach and systematic review grounded in the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, we analyze the incident to identify patterns of human-centric vulnerabilities and governance challenges common to organizational security failures. Findings emphasize three critical points. (1) Organizational security depends heavily on human behavior, with internal actors often serving as the weakest link despite advanced technical defenses; (2) Leadership tone strongly influences organizational security culture and efficacy, and (3) widespread reliance on technical solutions without sufficient investments in human and organizational factors leads to ineffective practices and wasted resources. From these observations, we propose actionable recommendations for enhancing organizational and national security, including strong leadership engagement, comprehensive adoption of zero-trust architectures, clearer accountability structures, incentivized security behaviors, and rigorous oversight. Particularly during periods of organizational transition, such as mergers or large-scale personnel changes, additional measures become particularly important. Signalgate underscores the need for leaders and policymakers to reorient cybersecurity strategies toward addressing governance, cultural, and behavioral risks.",

Traditional search engines typically rely on a cascaded architecture, where results are retrieved through recall, pre-ranking, and ranking stages. The complexity of designing and maintaining multiple modules makes it difficult to achieve holistic performance gains. Recent advances in generative recommendation have motivated the exploration of unified generative search as an alternative. However, existing approaches are not genuinely end-to-end: they typically train an item encoder to tokenize candidates first and then optimize a generator separately, leading to objective inconsistency and limited generalization. To address these limitations, we propose UniSearch, a unified generative search framework for Kuaishou Search. UniSearch replaces the cascaded pipeline with an end-to-end architecture that integrates a Search Generator and a Video Encoder. The Generator produces semantic identifiers of relevant items given a user query, while the Video Encoder learns latent item embeddings and provides their tokenized representations. A unified training framework jointly optimizes both components, enabling mutual enhancement and improving representation quality and generation accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce Search Preference Optimization (SPO), which leverages a reward model and real user feedback to better align generation with user preferences. Extensive experiments on industrial-scale datasets, together with online A/B testing in both short-video and live search scenarios, demonstrate the strong effectiveness and deployment potential of UniSearch. Notably, its deployment in live search yields the largest single-experiment improvement in recent years of our product's history, highlighting its practical value for real-world applications.",

However, a reliable and comprehensive approach is lacking for comparative performance analysis of outlier detection methods. To fill this gap, this work proposes and applies an empirical worst-case analysis as a general solution.

While large language models are increasingly used for these similarity assessments, questions remain about whether they truly understand semantic relationships or merely recognize surface patterns.   The study tested 18 different similarity measurement approaches, including word-based methods, embedding techniques, LLM-based systems, and structure-aware algorithms. The researchers created a systematic testing framework that applies controlled changes to text and code to evaluate how well each method handles different types of semantic relationships.   The results revealed significant issues with commonly used metrics. Some embedding-based methods incorrectly identified semantic opposites as similar up to 99.9 percent of the time, while certain transformer-based approaches occasionally rated opposite meanings as more similar than synonymous ones. The study found that embedding methods' poor performance often stemmed from how they calculate distances; switching from Euclidean distance to cosine similarity improved results by 24 to 66 percent. LLM-based approaches performed better at distinguishing semantic differences, producing low similarity scores (0.00 to 0.29) for genuinely different meanings, compared to embedding methods that incorrectly assigned high scores (0.82 to 0.99) to dissimilar content.",

This study examines how HR managers' AI literacy influences their subjective perception and objective understanding of explainable AI (XAI) elements in recruiting recommender dashboards. In an online experiment, 410 German-based HR managers compared baseline dashboards to versions enriched with three XAI styles: important features, counterfactuals, and model criteria. Our results show that the dashboards used in practice do not explain AI results and even keep AI elements opaque. However, while adding XAI features improves subjective perceptions of helpfulness and trust among users with moderate or high AI literacy, it does not increase their objective understanding. It may even reduce accurate understanding, especially with complex explanations. Only overlays of important features significantly aided the interpretations of high-literacy users. Our findings highlight that the benefits of XAI in recruitment depend on users' AI literacy, emphasizing the need for tailored explanation strategies and targeted literacy training in HRM to ensure fair, transparent, and effective adoption of AI.",

            "abstract": "The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software engineering tasks is growing, especially in the areas of bug fixing and code generation. Nevertheless, these models often yield unstable results; when executed at different times with the same input, they can generate radically different code. The consistency of LLMs in bug-fixing tasks has not yet been thoroughly assessed, despite the fact that this instability has typically been discussed in the literature in relation to code generation. The purpose of this study is to look into how unstable an LLM like ChatGPT is when it comes to fixing code bugs. We examine the structural, syntactic, and functional variations among several fix recommendations made in response to the same prompt using code samples with various error types. Additionally, we assess how instability is affected by the temperature settings (0, 0.5, and 1) used for the model's deterministic operation. For a total of 20 problems in the experimental analysis, the model produced three fix suggestions at each temperature value, comparing nine distinct outputs for each problem. The Syntax Similarity and Output Equivalence Rate (OER) metrics were used to assess the outputs' structural and functional consistency. The results demonstrate that the model's outputs become much more unstable and variable as the temperature rises, with high temperatures showing especially high rates of functional failure. According to syntax similarity analyses, the suggested fixes show notable structural differences at high temperatures but are fairly similar at low temperatures. The purpose of this study is to provide important methodological insights into how LLM-based error correction systems can be applied more consistently in software development processes while also casting doubt on their dependability.",

As the primary architects of XR applications, developers play a critical role in addressing novel threats. However, to effectively support developers, we must first understand how they perceive and respond to different threats. Despite the growing importance of this issue, there is a lack of in-depth, threat-aware studies that examine XR S&P from the developers' perspective. To fill this gap, we interviewed 23 professional XR developers with a focus on emerging threats in XR. Our study addresses two research questions aiming to uncover existing problems in XR development and identify actionable paths forward.   By examining developers' perceptions of S&P threats, we found that: (1) XR development decisions (e.g., rich sensor data collection, user-generated content interfaces) are closely tied to and can amplify S&P threats, yet developers are often unaware of these risks, resulting in cognitive biases in threat perception; and (2) limitations in existing mitigation methods, combined with insufficient strategic, technical, and communication support, undermine developers' motivation, awareness, and ability to effectively address these threats. Based on these findings, we propose actionable and stakeholder-aware recommendations to improve XR S&P throughout the XR development process. This work represents the first effort to undertake a threat-aware, developer-centered study in the XR domain -- an area where the immersive, data-rich nature of the XR technology introduces distinctive challenges.",

With the growth of Smart and Connected Communities, generative AI, especially large language models (LLMs), may help by processing contextual information and producing practitioner readable recommendations. We evaluate seven LLMs (ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, Llama, and Claude) on residential retrofit decisions under two objectives: maximizing CO2 reduction (technical) and minimizing payback period (sociotechnical). Performance is assessed on four dimensions: accuracy, consistency, sensitivity, and reasoning, using a dataset of 400 homes across 49 US states. LLMs generate effective recommendations in many cases, reaching up to 54.5 percent top 1 match and 92.8 percent within top 5 without fine tuning. Performance is stronger for the technical objective, while sociotechnical decisions are limited by economic trade offs and local context. Agreement across models is low, and higher performing models tend to diverge from others. LLMs are sensitive to location and building geometry but less sensitive to technology and occupant behavior. Most models show step by step, engineering style reasoning, but it is often simplified and lacks deeper contextual awareness. Overall, LLMs are promising assistants for energy retrofit decision making, but improvements in accuracy, consistency, and context handling are needed for reliable practice.",

While software organizations are recommended to conduct postmortems, the effectiveness and adoption of these practices vary widely. Understanding how engineers gather, document, share, and apply lessons from failures is essential for improving reliability and preventing recurrence. High-reliability organizations (HROs) often develop software systems where failures carry catastrophic risks, requiring continuous learning to ensure reliability. These organizations provide a valuable setting to examine practices and challenges for learning from software failures. Such insight could help develop processes and tools to improve reliability and prevent recurrence. However, we lack in-depth industry perspectives on the practices and challenges of learning from failures.   To address this gap, we conducted a case study through 10 in-depth interviews with research software engineers at a national space research center. We examine how they learn from failures: how they gather, document, share, and apply lessons. To assess transferability, we include data from 5 additional interviews at other HROs. Our findings provide insight into how engineers learn from failures in practice. To summarize: (1) failure learning is informal, ad hoc, and inconsistently integrated into SDLC; (2) recurring failures persist due to absence of structured processes; and (3) key challenges, including time constraints, knowledge loss from turnover and fragmented documentation, and weak process enforcement, undermine systematic learning. Our findings deepen understanding of how software engineers learn from failures and offer guidance for improving failure management practices.",

However, their widespread adoption is often hindered by limited transparency in how algorithmic components influence performance. This work presents a multi-faceted investigation of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to further understand the key role of different topologies for better interpretability and explainability. To achieve this objective, we first develop a comprehensive landscape characterization framework using Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) to quantify problem difficulty and identify critical features affecting the optimization performance of PSO. Next, we conduct a rigorous empirical study comparing three fundamental swarm communication architectures -- Ring, Star, and Von Neumann topologies -- analysing their distinct impacts on exploration-exploitation balance, convergence behaviour, and solution quality and eventually develop an explainable benchmarking framework for PSO, to decode how swarm topologies affects information flow, diversity, and convergence. Based on this, a novel machine learning approach for automated algorithm configuration is introduced for training predictive models on extensive Area over the Convergence Curve (AOCC) data to recommend optimal settings based on problem characteristics. Through systematic experimentation across twenty four benchmark functions in multiple dimensions, we establish practical guidelines for topology selection and parameter configuration. These findings advance the development of more transparent and reliable swarm intelligence systems. The source codes of this work can be accessed at https://github.com/GitNitin02/ioh_pso.",

While extensive prior work has addressed tensor completion with data missingness, most assume that each entry of the tensor is available independently with probability $p$. However, real-world tensor data often exhibit missing-not-at-random (MNAR) patterns, where the probability of missingness depends on the underlying tensor values. This paper introduces a generalized tensor completion framework for noisy data with MNAR, where the observation probability is modeled as a function of underlying tensor values. Our flexible framework accommodates various tensor data types, such as continuous, binary and count data. For model estimation, we develop an alternating maximization algorithm and derive non-asymptotic error bounds for the estimator at each iteration, under considerably relaxed conditions on the observation probabilities. Additionally, we propose a statistical inference procedure to test whether observation probabilities depend on underlying tensor values, offering a formal assessment of the missingness assumption within our modeling framework. The utility and efficacy of our approach are demonstrated through comparative simulation studies and analyses of two real-world datasets.",

Here, we use well-constrained measurements of snow that has metamorphosed into coarse-grained firn and bubbly glacier ice in East Antarctica to test three commonly-used radiative transfer models: delta-Eddington, Hapke, and Shkuratov. Using the measured optical properties, we find that the delta-Eddington model generally shows the least deviation from the measured albedo, followed by the Shkuratov and Hapke models, respectively. But when the models are used to infer the grain radius using the measured albedo, the Shkuratov model provides closer best-fit grain radii (off by average factor 0.9) than delta-Eddington (0.6), and Hapke (1.8). Despite this, the spectral albedos estimated by the Shkuratov and Hapke models using their respective best-fit grain radii deviate more from the measurements than delta-Eddington. This result is caused by the Hapke and Shkuratov models not accounting for: (1) the increased absorption within dense ice, and (2) specular reflection at the surface of firn and ice. Additionally, all three models do not account for the nonsphericity of bubbles within ice. The combination of these factors leads to model errors generally increasing with increasing grain radius. Based on our quantitative comparison, we recommend using the delta-Eddington model for predicting the albedo and inferring the grain radius of ices across the solar system because it generally produces the least error while using realistic physical parameters.",

Our method uses a neural retriever to fetch relevant items for a user query and computes the entropy of the re-ranked scores to dynamically route the dialogue policy: low-entropy (specific) queries trigger direct recommendations, whereas high-entropy (ambiguous) queries prompt exploratory questions.

In this work, we investigate both paradigms in model-based settings, conducting experiments on 31 different environments. First, we showcase that online agents outperform their offline counterparts. We identify a key challenge behind performance degradation of offline agents: encountering Out-Of-Distribution states at test time. This issue arises because, without the self-correction mechanism in online agents, offline datasets with limited state space coverage induce a mismatch between the agent's imagination and real rollouts, compromising policy training. We demonstrate that this issue can be mitigated by allowing for additional online interactions in a fixed or adaptive schedule, restoring the performance of online training with limited interaction data. We also showcase that incorporating exploration data helps mitigate the performance degradation of offline agents. Based on our insights, we recommend adding exploration data when collecting large datasets, as current efforts predominantly focus on expert data alone.",

            "abstract": "Truly unsupervised approaches for time series anomaly detection are rare in the literature. Those that exist suffer from a poorly set threshold, which hampers detection performance, while others, despite claiming to be unsupervised, need to be calibrated using a labelled data subset, which is often not available in the real world. This work integrates active learning with an existing unsupervised anomaly detection method by selectively querying the labels of multivariate time series, which are then used to refine the threshold selection process. To achieve this, we introduce a novel query strategy called the dissimilarity-based query strategy (DQS). DQS aims to maximise the diversity of queried samples by evaluating the similarity between anomaly scores using dynamic time warping. We assess the detection performance of DQS in comparison to other query strategies and explore the impact of mislabelling, a topic that is underexplored in the literature. Our findings indicate that DQS performs best in small-budget scenarios, though the others appear to be more robust when faced with mislabelling. Therefore, in the real world, the choice of query strategy depends on the expertise of the oracle and the number of samples they are willing to label. Regardless, all query strategies outperform the unsupervised threshold even in the presence of mislabelling. Thus, whenever it is feasible to query an oracle, employing an active learning-based threshold is recommended.",

In this work, the spatial failure-time data of focus contains information on GPUs that are connected through a network fabric topology that differs from their physical layout and that is expected to introduce additional correlations. The proposed lifetime regression model includes random effects capturing the dependency due to physical location as well as random effects explaining the dependency due to logical connections between GPUs. The analysis of this GPU dataset serves as an example of models with multiple spatial random effects and the ideas presented can be extended to other applications with complex spatial structures. A Bayesian modeling scheme is recommended for this class of analyses. The examples in this work use the software package, Stan, to produce Markov chain Monte Carlo draws for parameter estimation.

In this work, we propose a general Deep Reinforcement Learning framework for Personalized Utility Tuning (DRL-PUT) to address the challenges of multi-objective optimization within ad recommender systems. Our key contributions include: 1) Formulating the problem as a reinforcement learning task: given the state of an ad request, we predict the optimal hyperparameters to maximize a pre-defined reward. 2) Developing an approach to directly learn an optimal policy model using online serving logs, avoiding the need to estimate a value function, which is inherently challenging due to the high variance and unbalanced distribution of immediate rewards. We evaluated DRL-PUT through an online A/B experiment in Pinterest's ad recommender system. Compared to the baseline manual utility tuning approach, DRL-PUT improved the click-through rate by 9.7% and the long click-through rate by 7.7% on the treated segment. We conducted a detailed ablation study on the impact of different reward definitions and analyzed the personalization aspect of the learned policy model.",

Traditional interest modeling methods often rely on unimodal data, such as click logs or text labels, which limits their ability to fully capture user preferences in a complex multimodal content environment. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a multimodal foundation model-based framework for user interest modeling and behavior analysis. By integrating video frames, textual descriptions, and background music into a unified semantic space using cross-modal alignment strategies, the framework constructs fine-grained user interest vectors. Additionally, we introduce a behavior-driven feature embedding mechanism that incorporates viewing, liking, and commenting sequences to model dynamic interest evolution, thereby improving both the timeliness and accuracy of recommendations. In the experimental phase, we conduct extensive evaluations using both public and proprietary short video datasets, comparing our approach against multiple mainstream recommendation algorithms and modeling techniques. Results demonstrate significant improvements in behavior prediction accuracy, interest modeling for cold-start users, and recommendation click-through rates. Moreover, we incorporate interpretability mechanisms using attention weights and feature visualization to reveal the model's decision basis under multimodal inputs and trace interest shifts, thereby enhancing the transparency and controllability of the recommendation system.",

Drawing primarily on the California Consumer Privacy Act, we develop a novel qualitative coding schema that we apply to each developer's relevant privacy policies to compare data collection and use practices across the six companies. We find that all six developers appear to employ their users' chat data to train and improve their models by default, and that some retain this data indefinitely. Developers may collect and train on personal information disclosed in chats, including sensitive information such as biometric and health data, as well as files uploaded by users. Four of the six companies we examined appear to include children's chat data for model training, as well as customer data from other products. On the whole, developers' privacy policies often lack essential information about their practices, highlighting the need for greater transparency and accountability. We address the implications of users' lack of consent for the use of their chat data for model training, data security issues arising from indefinite chat data retention, and training on children's chat data.

Nowadays, practically every industry uses artificial models to automate their operations. To explore their role, we examined three prominent LLMs (OpenAI, GeminiAI, Deepseek) in multiple stages of textile manufacturing (e.g., sustainable choice, cost effectiveness, production planning, etc.). We assessed the models' ability to replicate garment design using certain parameters (fabric construction, shade, weave, silhouette, etc.). We compared the models in terms of different body types and functional purposes (e.g., fashionwear, sportswear) so that designers could evaluate effectiveness before developing actual patterns, make necessary modifications, and conduct fashion forecasting beforehand. To facilitate deeper analysis, we created a custom dataset specifically for fabric image generation and classification. Our analysis revealed that, in terms of fabric construction, the OpenAI DALL-E model integrated with ChatGPT outperformed other models, achieving a lower LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity) score of approximately $0.2$. In fabric classification from images, we found OpenAI offered the best results by breaking down certain factors (e.g., breathability, moisture-wicking, and tactile comfort), achieving approximately $80\\%$ accuracy for base construction and $55\\%$ for detailed construction. However, our results indicate that Deepseek faced significant challenges in generating and recognizing fabric images. Overall, all the models struggled to recognize complex fabric constructions and intricate designs from images, and relying too much on AI might hinder human creativity. We also observed that all three models performed effectively in providing recommendations and insights for fabric design in textual form.",

However, these groups remain understudied in cybersecurity research. This gap in understanding, coupled with their exclusion from broader security and privacy policies, increases their susceptibility to phishing and widens the digital security divide between marginalized and non-marginalized populations. To address this gap, we first conducted digital literacy workshops with newly resettled African refugee populations (n = 48) in the US to improve their understanding of how to safeguard sensitive and private information. Following the workshops, we conducted a real-world phishing deception study using carefully designed emails with linguistic cues for three participant groups: a subset of the African US-refugees recruited from the digital literacy workshops (n = 19), African immigrant students in the US (n = 142), and a control group of monolingual US-born students (n = 184). Our findings indicate that while digital literacy training for refugees improves awareness of safe cybersecurity practices, recently resettled African US-refugees still face significant challenges due to low digital literacy skills and limited English proficiency. This often leads them to ignore or fail to recognize phishing emails as phishing. Both African immigrant students and US-born students showed greater caution, though instances of data disclosure remained prevalent across groups. Our findings highlight, irrespective of literacy, the need to be trained to think critically about digital security. We conclude by discussing how the security and privacy community can better include marginalized populations in policy making and offer recommendations for designing equitable, inclusive cybersecurity initiatives.",

A unified representation learning framework is proposed. The framework builds a multi-intent representation module and an uncertainty modeling mechanism. It extracts multi-granularity interest structures from user behavior sequences. Behavioral ambiguity and preference fluctuation are captured using Bayesian distribution modeling. In the multi-intent modeling part, the model introduces multiple latent intent vectors. These vectors are weighted and fused using an attention mechanism to generate semantically rich representations of long-term user preferences. In the uncertainty modeling part, the model learns the mean and covariance of behavior representations through Gaussian distributions. This reflects the user's confidence in different behavioral contexts. Next, a learnable fusion strategy is used to combine long-term intent and short-term behavior signals. This produces the final user representation, improving both recommendation accuracy and robustness. The method is evaluated on standard public datasets. Experimental results show that it outperforms existing representative models across multiple metrics. It also demonstrates greater stability and adaptability under cold-start and behavioral disturbance scenarios. The approach alleviates modeling bottlenecks faced by traditional methods when dealing with complex user behavior.

Failing to address these issues can result in unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and lateral movement within clusters. Most existing K8s security solutions focus on detecting misconfigurations, typically through static analysis or anomaly detection. In contrast, this paper presents KubeGuard, a novel runtime log-driven recommender framework aimed at mitigating risks by addressing overly permissive configurations. KubeGuard is designed to harden K8s environments through two complementary tasks: Resource Creation and Resource Refinement. It leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze manifests and runtime logs reflecting actual system behavior, using modular prompt-chaining workflows. This approach enables KubeGuard to create least-privilege configurations for new resources and refine existing manifests to reduce the attack surface. KubeGuard's output manifests are presented as recommendations that users (e.g., developers and operators) can review and adopt to enhance cluster security. Our evaluation demonstrates that KubeGuard effectively generates and refines K8s manifests for Roles, NetworkPolicies, and Deployments, leveraging both proprietary and open-source LLMs. The high precision, recall, and F1-scores affirm KubeGuard's practicality as a framework that translates runtime observability into actionable, least-privilege configuration guidance.",

            "abstract": "Distributed training of large deep-learning models often leads to failures, so checkpointing is commonly employed for recovery. State-of-the-art studies focus on frequent checkpointing for fast recovery from failures. However, it generates numerous checkpoints, incurring substantial costs and thus degrading training performance. Recently, differential checkpointing has been proposed to reduce costs, but it is limited to recommendation systems, so its application to general distributed training systems remains unexplored.   This paper proposes LowDiff, an efficient frequent checkpointing framework that \\textit{reuses} compressed gradients, serving as differential checkpoints to reduce cost. Furthermore, LowDiff incorporates a batched gradient write optimization to persist these differentials to storage efficiently. It also dynamically tunes both the checkpoint frequency and the batching size to maximize performance. We further enhance LowDiff with a layer-wise gradient reusing and snapshotting approach and a CPU-based asynchronous persistence strategy, enabling frequent checkpointing without gradient compression. Experiments on various workloads show that LowDiff can achieve checkpointing frequency up to per iteration with less than 3.1\\% runtime overhead.",

However, this reliance on untrusted user input introduces a novel and underexplored attack surface. In this paper, we investigate the security risks posed by adversarial bug reports -- realistic-looking issue submissions crafted to mislead APR systems into producing insecure or harmful code changes. We develop a comprehensive threat model and conduct an empirical study to evaluate the vulnerability of state-of-the-art APR systems to such attacks. Our demonstration comprises 51 adversarial bug reports generated across a spectrum of strategies, from manual curation to fully automated pipelines. We test these against leading APR model and assess both pre-repair defenses (e.g., LlamaGuard variants, PromptGuard variants, Granite-Guardian, and custom LLM filters) and post-repair detectors (GitHub Copilot, CodeQL). Our findings show that current defenses are insufficient: 90\\% of crafted bug reports triggered attacker-aligned patches. The best pre-repair filter blocked only 47\\%, while post-repair analysis-often requiring human oversight-was effective in just 58\\% of cases. To support scalable security testing, we introduce a prototype framework for automating the generation of adversarial bug reports. Our analysis exposes a structural asymmetry: generating adversarial inputs is inexpensive, while detecting or mitigating them remains costly and error-prone. We conclude with practical recommendations for improving the robustness of APR systems against adversarial misuse and highlight directions for future work on trustworthy automated repair.",

Yet many of our tools for climate prediction and projection lack accurate representations of these environments. We also lack the observations and datasets needed to evaluate model performance. This paper identifies critical gaps in Australias current capability, showing how they undermine climate impact and risk assessments in cities and may lead to poorly designed adaptation and mitigation strategies. These gaps, and the recommendations to address them, were identified through consultation with experts across research institutes, universities, two ARC Centres of Excellence, federal and state governments, and private agencies.   Our recommendations span four key areas: city descriptive datasets, integrated observations, fit for purpose models, and a coordinated community of research and practice. Urgent action is needed to tailor models to Australia's unique urban landscapes and climates. This requires comprehensive, nationally consistent, high resolution datasets that capture the form, fabric, and function of contemporary and future cities. It also requires filling systematic gaps in integrated networks of urban climate observations for evaluation and benchmarking. At the same time, scientific understanding of key urban processes that influence weather and climate must advance, alongside improvements in their representation in physical models. This can be achieved through a national community of research and practice that codesigns and oversees an implementation plan, integrated with infrastructure such as ACCESS NRI and AURIN. Building this capability will enable us to answer critical questions about the interaction between cities and climate, protecting Australias urban populations and ensuring a resilient future.",

Participatory Monitoring and Evaluation (PM&E) methodologies ensure that local communities play an active role in decision-making, leading to more sustainable outcomes. Given the complex socio-political landscape of Kisumu Central Sub-County, there is a critical need for inclusive and context-responsive project monitoring strategies. Initiatives that have integrated local leaders, youth groups, and women-led organizations into their M&E processes tend to achieve stronger community buy-in, improved continuity, and more impactful outcomes. The current study explored the influence of stakeholder involvement in M&E on the performance of donor-funded projects in informal settlements in Kisumu Central Sub-County, Kenya. The study was guided by Stakeholder Engagement Theory. The study used a Convergent Parallel design with a sample size of 364 respondents computed using Yamanes' Sampling formula, drawn from 27 donor-funded projects in Obunga and Nyalenda informal Settlements. Purposive sampling was used for project managers, project M&E staff, and community members served, while community members were selected using stratified random sampling. The study findings revealed that there were regular opportunities for stakeholder interaction in the projects (x =4.05, SD 1.08), stakeholders contributed to the development of the organization/project (x= 3.79, SD=.940), although stakeholders' perspectives and opinions were not diligently incorporated into programming (x=2.06, SD=.879) as anticipated. The study, therefore, concluded that stakeholder involvement in M&E influenced the performance of donor-funded projects. The study recommended that the project managers in donor-funded projects need to enhance stakeholder involvement for project ownership and sustainability.",

Using a panel of 113 countries (1995 2022), we combine: (i) the economic ideology of the executive branch (V Dem), (ii) the disaggregated institutional quality of the economic freedom index (Heritage), separating a core institutional block (HN: property rights, government integrity, judicial effectiveness) from a block of liberalization policies (HL: trade/financial openness, regulatory efficiency, size of government), and (iii) economic performance (GDP per capita PPP and its growth, World Bank). We estimate panel models with fixed effects by country and year, and standard errors grouped by country. We find that HN is strongly associated with higher income levels, while HL, on average globally, is not significant for income level once HN is controlled for, nor does it consistently predict short term growth. Government ideology exhibits weak direct effects on growth, although it operates indirectly via HL (right wing governments tend to have higher HL scores). Robustness tests with long five-year differences and country specific trends reinforce that, in the long run, \"institutions prevail over politics.\" We conclude with recommendations for developing countries: prioritize the institutional core (rule of law, anti-corruption, effective justice) as a basis for policies whether left-wing or right wing to bear fruit in terms of growth",

We do not impose any spectral index constraints, but only fit for template amplitudes at each target frequency. We clean WMAP and Planck maps at a set of target frequencies and conduct quality tests at the level of the maps, pixel histograms and power spectra to select four CMB maps that are cleaned with negligible foreground contamination and only 1% masked pixels and no inpainting.

To promote sustainable urban development, it is necessary to further investigate the principles and applications of smart growth. In this paper, we propose a Smart Growth Index (SGI) as a standard for measuring the degree of responsible urban development. Based on this index, we construct a comprehensive 3E evaluation model (covering economic prosperity, social equity, and environmental sustainability) to systematically assess the level of smart growth. For empirical analysis, we selected two medium-sized cities from different continents: Wuhu County, China, and Colima, Mexico. Using an improved entropy method, we evaluated the degree of smart growth in recent years and analyzed the contributions of various policies to sustainable urban development. Guided by the ten principles of smart growth, we further linked theoretical insights to practical challenges and formulated a development plan for both cities. To forecast long-term trends, we employed trend extrapolation based on historical data, enabling the prediction of SGI values for 2020, 2030, and 2050. The results indicate that Wuhu demonstrates greater potential for smart growth compared with Colima. We also simulated a scenario in which the population of both cities increased by 50 percent and re-evaluated the SGI. The analysis suggests that while rapid population growth tends to slow the pace of smart growth, it does not necessarily exert a negative impact on the overall trajectory of sustainable development. Finally, we conducted a study on the application of Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) theory in Wuhu County and proposed several policy recommendations aimed at enhancing the city's sustainable urban development.",

However, such interaction data is often subject to position bias, as users are more likely to click on items that appear higher in the ranking, regardless of their actual relevance. As a result, newly trained models may inherit and reinforce the biases of prior ranking models rather than genuinely improving relevance. A standard approach to mitigate position bias is Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS), where the model's loss is weighted by the inverse of a propensity function, an estimate of the probability that an item at a given position is examined. However, accurate propensity estimation is challenging, especially in interfaces with complex non-linear layouts. In this paper, we propose a novel method for estimating position bias using Large Language Models (LLMs) applied to logged user interaction data. This approach offers a cost-effective alternative to online experimentation. Our experiments show that propensities estimated with our LLM-as-a-judge approach are stable across score buckets and reveal the row-column effects of Viator's grid layout that simpler heuristics overlook. An IPS-weighted reranker trained with these propensities matches the production model on standard NDCG@10 while improving weighted NDCG@10 by roughly 2%.

Although the 1MP can be solved exactly by computing the single-source shortest paths from each customer node, such approaches become computationally expensive on large-scale graphs with millions of nodes. In many real-world applications, such as recommendation systems based on large-scale knowledge graphs, the number of nodes (i.e., potential facility locations) is enormous, whereas the number of customer nodes is relatively small and spatially concentrated. In such cases, exhaustive graph exploration is not only inefficient but also unnecessary. Leveraging this observation, we propose three approximation algorithms that reduce computation by terminating Dijkstra's algorithm early. We provide theoretical analysis showing that one of the proposed algorithms guarantees an approximation ratio of 2, whereas the other two improve this ratio to 1.618. We demonstrate that the lower bound of the approximation ratio is 1.2 by presenting a specific instance. Moreover, we show that all proposed algorithms return optimal solutions when the number of customer nodes is less than or equal to three. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our algorithms significantly outperform baseline exact methods in runtime while maintaining near-optimal accuracy across all tested graph types. Notably, on grid graphs with 10 million nodes, our algorithms obtains all optimal solutions within 1 millisecond, whereas the baseline exact method requires over 70 seconds on average.",

Proximal cell rewiring is routinely recommended to reduce technical failure, and DKC is considered effective across various bifurcation angles. However, it remains unclear whether this standard approach is optimal for all patients. This study investigates the interaction between bifurcation angle and rewiring configuration to identify anatomy-specific strategies. Methods Computational modeling of the DKC procedure was used to simulate 12 DKC procedures across three left main bifurcation angles (45{\\deg}, 70{\\deg}, and 100{\\deg}) and four rewiring configurations: proximal-proximal (P-P), proximal-distal (P-D), distal-proximal (D-P), and distal-distal (D-D). Evaluation metrics included stent malapposition, side branch ostium clearance, arterial wall stress, low time-averaged endothelial shear stress, and high shear rates. Results DKC performed in wide bifurcations (100{\\deg}) resulted in worse outcomes, with malapposition reaching 18%, side branch clearance down to 23%, and up to twice the exposure to adverse high shear rates compared to narrower angles. In contrast, intermediate (70{\\deg}) and narrow (45{\\deg}) angles generally resulted in more favorable outcomes, though optimal rewiring varied by angle. Proximal strategies, i.e. P-P and P-D, were most effective at 70{\\deg}, while D-D performed best at 45{\\deg}. No single strategy was consistently superior across all bifurcation angles. Conclusions DKC outcomes depend on bifurcation angle and can be optimized by tailoring rewiring strategies, challenging the current clinical understanding. These findings support anatomy-specific procedural planning and intravascular imaging to guide rewiring. This study provides a mechanistic rationale to improve clinical decision-making and tailor bifurcation interventions.",

            "abstract": "Protected user-level libraries have been proposed as a way to allow mutually distrusting applications to safely share kernel-bypass services. In this paper, we identify and solve several previously unaddressed obstacles to realizing this design and identify several optimization opportunities. First, to preserve the kernel's ability to reclaim failed processes, protected library functions must complete in modest, bounded time. We show how to move unbounded waits outside the library itself, enabling synchronous interaction among processes without the need for polling. Second, we show how the bounded time requirement can be leveraged to achieve lower and more stable latency for inter-process interactions. Third, we observe that prior work on protected libraries is vulnerable to a buffer unmapping attack; we prevent this attack by preventing applications from removing pages that they share with the protected library. Fourth, we show how a trusted daemon can respond to asynchronous events and dynamically divide work with application threads in a protected library.   By extending and improving the protected library model, our work provides a new way to structure OS services, combining the advantages of kernel bypass and microkernels. We present a set of safety and performance guidelines for developers of protected libraries, and a set of recommendations for developers of future protected library operating systems. We demonstrate the convenience and performance of our approach with a prototype version of the DDS communication service. To the best of our knowledge, this prototype represents the first successful sharing of a kernel-bypass NIC among mutually untrusting applications. Relative to the commercial FastDDS implementation, we achieve approximately 50\\% lower latency and up to 7x throughput, with lower CPU utilization.",

However, recommending general merchandise to customers focused on grocery shopping -- such as pairing milk with a milk frother -- remains a critical yet under-explored challenge. This paper introduces a cross-pollination (XP) framework, a novel approach that bridges grocery and general merchandise cross-category recommendations by leveraging multi-source product associations and real-time cart context. Our solution employs a two-stage framework: (1) A candidate generation mechanism that uses co-purchase market basket analysis and LLM-based approach to identify novel item-item associations; and (2) a transformer-based ranker that leverages the real-time sequential cart context and optimizes for engagement signals such as add-to-carts. Offline analysis and online A/B tests show an increase of 36\\% add-to-cart rate with LLM-based retrieval, and 27\\% NDCG\\@4 lift using cart context-based ranker.

In spite of the simplicity and familiarity of this distribution, there is considerable confusion among physicists concerning the description of results obtained via Poisson sampling. The goal of this paper is to mitigate this confusion by examining and comparing the properties of both conventional and popular alternative techniques. We concern ourselves in particular with the description of results, as opposed to interpretation. After considering performance with respect to several desirable properties we recommend summarizing the results of Poisson sampling with confidence intervals proposed by Garwood. We note that the $p$ values obtained from these intervals are well-behaved and intuitive, providing for a consistent treatment. We also find that averaging intervals can be problematic if the underlying Poisson distributions are not used. The considerations here provide a basis for describing results from other distributions as well.",

For high throughput information arranged in matrix format, recomputing an optimal SVD approximation after each step is typically prohibitive. Instead, incremental and truncated updating strategies are used, which may not scale for large truncation ranks. Therefore, we propose a set of efficient new algorithms that update a bidiagonal factorization, and which are similarly accurate as the SVD methods. In particular, we develop a compact Householder-type algorithm that decouples a sparse part from a low-rank update and has about half the memory requirements of standard bidiagonalization methods. A second algorithm based on Givens rotations has only about 10 flops per rotation and scales quadratically with the problem size, compared to a typical cubic scaling. The algorithm is therefore effective for processing high-throughput updates, as we demonstrate in tracking large subspaces of recommendation systems and networks, and when compared to well known software such as LAPACK or the incremental SVD.",

We present a Decision Transformer (DT) based framework that reframes policy learning as return-conditioned supervised learning, improving robustness, scalability, and modeling flexibility. Our contributions include a real-world comparison with CQL, a multi-reward design suitable for non-episodic tasks, a quantile regression approach to return-to-go conditioning, and a production-ready system with circular buffer-based sequence processing for near-real-time inference. Extensive offline and online experiments in a deployed notification system show that our approach improves notification utility and overall session activity while minimizing user fatigue.

This study addresses this gap by employing Classical Test Theory (CTT) to evaluate the psychometric properties of the ADT among Chinese university students. This study finds a robust correlation between the ADT and the CET-6 writing and translation subscores. In addition, there is a high level of expert agreement regarding the construct validity evidence and the appropriateness of the scoring rubric. Furthermore, the results indicate that gender differences in validity indices are minimal. Taken together, these results suggest that the ADT is a valid measure for Chinese test-takers without gender discrimination. However, it is recommended that the cultural sensitivity of the scoring rubric be further refined and that the CET-6 subscores for writing be retained for predictive purposes, in order to better accommodate the needs of diverse test-taker populations. By addressing these issues, this study contributes to the broader discourse on fairness and validity in high-stakes language assessments.",

The findings reveal that while LLMs demonstrate adequate performance in structured domains such as legal compliance, they exhibit significant deficiencies in handling contextual nuance, ensuring accountability, and providing transparent reasoning.

Existing fairness evaluation methods fall short in these contexts as they typically use simplistic metrics that overlook the multi-dimensional nature of medical harms. This also promotes models that are fair only because they are clinically inert, defaulting to safe but potentially inaccurate outputs. To address this gap, our contributions are mainly two-fold: first, we construct two large-scale, controlled benchmarks (ED-Triage and Opioid Analgesic Recommendation) from MIMIC-IV, comprising over 50,000 prompts with twelve race x gender variants and three context tiers. Second, we propose a multi-metric framework - Multi-faceted Fairness Assessment based on hARMs ($mFARM$) to audit fairness for three distinct dimensions of disparity (Allocational, Stability, and Latent) and aggregate them into an $mFARM$ score. We also present an aggregated Fairness-Accuracy Balance (FAB) score to benchmark and observe trade-offs between fairness and prediction accuracy. We empirically evaluate four open-source LLMs (Mistral-7B, BioMistral-7B, Qwen-2.5-7B, Bio-LLaMA3-8B) and their finetuned versions under quantization and context variations. Our findings showcase that the proposed $mFARM$ metrics capture subtle biases more effectively under various settings. We find that most models maintain robust performance in terms of $mFARM$ score across varying levels of quantization but deteriorate significantly when the context is reduced.

Results indicate uneven and generally insufficient preparedness: while PQC standards and niche QKD deployments signal technical progress, fewer than 5\\% of enterprises have formal quantum-transition plans, and many underestimate \"harvest now, decrypt later\" risks. Financial, telecom, and government sectors have begun migration, but most industries remain exploratory or stalled by costs, complexity, and skills gaps. Expert consensus places cryptanalytically relevant quantum computers in the 2030s, yet delayed preparation could leave today's data vulnerable for decades.

Recent developments in interference-aware estimators such as Additive Inverse Propensity Weighting (AddIPW) have not found their way into the uplift modeling literature yet, and optimising policies using these estimators is not well-established. This paper proposes a practical methodology to bridge this gap. We use the AddIPW estimator as a differentiable learning objective suitable for gradient-based optimization. We demonstrate how this framework can be integrated with proven response transformation techniques to directly optimize for economic outcomes like incremental profit. Through simulations, we show that our approach significantly outperforms interference-naive methods, especially as interference effects grow.

We show that our numerical solution for the DCM model fulfills the three conditions of a well-posed problem: existence, uniqueness and stability. The Fisher-test is used to identify the best DCM model from all alternative tested DCM models. The correct DCM model must also pass our Predictivity-test. Our analyses of seven different simulated data samples expose the weaknesses of DFT and the efficiency of DCM.

Our measurements in the I$_C$ band revealed an average linear polarization of 1.60$\\pm$0.03\\% at position angle of 132.2\\degr. To distinguish between intrinsic and interstellar polarization, we also measured 86 field stars in the nova's vicinity, finding an average polarization of 1.25$\\pm$0.61\\% at a nearly identical position angle of 132\\degr. The strong consistency between the nova's polarization and that of the surrounding field stars suggests that the observed polarization is predominantly interstellar in origin. We found no significant evidence of an intrinsic polarization component, which would typically arise from an asymmetric distribution of ejected material. Further multi-band observations are recommended to confirm these findings.",

A simple cross-validation procedure selects the optimal estimator. Numerical simulations and applications to corporate finance data reveal that the best choice varies substantially across settings and often departs from Poisson regression, underscoring the need for a more flexible estimation framework.",

Our method exploits the Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to identify the causal impact and serve as a generative predictor. We are able to reduce confounding bias by identifying causally sensitive features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by recommending the most likely locations a user will visit next in their spatiotemporal trajectory influenced by the causal relationships among various features. Experiments on the large-scale GeoLife [Zheng et al., 2010] dataset and the benchmark Asia Bayesian network validate the ability of our method to identify causal impact and improve predictive performance.",

With the growing popularity of social media data and cameras embedded in smartphones, applying traditional computer vision techniques to localize images has become increasingly challenging, yet highly valuable. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates open-weight and publicly accessible multimodal large language models with retrieval-augmented generation. The method constructs a vector database using the SigLIP encoder on two large-scale datasets (EMP-16 and OSV-5M). Query images are augmented with prompts containing both similar and dissimilar geolocation information retrieved from this database before being processed by the multimodal large language models. Our approach has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, achieving higher accuracy compared against three widely used benchmark datasets (IM2GPS, IM2GPS3k, and YFCC4k). Importantly, our solution eliminates the need for expensive fine-tuning or retraining and scales seamlessly to incorporate new data sources. The effectiveness of retrieval-augmented generation-based multimodal large language models in geolocation estimation demonstrated by this paper suggests an alternative path to the traditional methods which rely on the training models from scratch, opening new possibilities for more accessible and scalable solutions in GeoAI.",

They appear in the form of indices, inventories, formative constructs, parcels, and emergent variables. Although structural equation modeling is widely used to study relations between variables, current approaches to incorporating composites have one or more limitations. These limitations include not modeling composite creation, not employing weights as model parameters, not being able to estimate weights, not allowing for composites in endogenous model positions, and not being able to assess whether a composite fully transmits the effects of or on its components. To address these limitations, we propose two novel composite specifications. The first specification combines the refined H-O specification of composites with phantom variables and uses the inverse of the weights as free parameters. The second specification blends the H-O specification with the pseudo-indicator approach of Rose et al. and uses the weights of all but one indicator as free parameters. We demonstrate the applicability of these specifications using an empirical example. The paper concludes with recommendations for choosing among the available composite specifications, as well as suggestions for future research.",

An awareness survey (n = 87) examined the usage of wearables and general PHI engagement, followed by semi-structured interviews (n = 22) that explored motivations, usage patterns, and health information sources. Qualitative analysis revealed that while PHI is valued for health monitoring and shared/collective care, its adoption is hindered by factors such as low health literacy, usability challenges, and mistrust in digital health platforms. Further stakeholder interviews and co-design workshops informed the development of a Figma-based prototype, which was evaluated for usability.

Despite the strong performance of current CTR models based on user behavior modeling, they are still severely limited by interaction sparsity, especially in low-active user scenarios. To address this issue, data augmentation of user behavior is a promising research direction. However, existing data augmentation methods heavily rely on collaborative signals while overlooking the rich multimodal features of items, leading to insufficient modeling of low-active users.   To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel framework \\textbf{MARS} (\\textbf{M}odality-\\textbf{A}ligned \\textbf{R}etrieval for \\textbf{S}equence Augmented CTR Prediction). MARS utilizes a Stein kernel-based approach to align text and image features into a unified and unbiased semantic space to construct multimodal user embeddings. Subsequently, each low-active user's behavior sequence is augmented by retrieving, filtering, and concentrating the most similar behavior sequence of high-active users via multimodal user embeddings. Validated by extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests, our framework MARS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves substantial growth on core business metrics within Kuaishou~\\footnote{https://www.kuaishou.com/}. Consequently, MARS has been successfully deployed, serving the main traffic for hundreds of millions of users.

This paper proposes a hybrid approach for classifying legal texts by combining unsupervised topic and graph embeddings with a supervised model. We employ Top2Vec to learn semantic document embeddings and automatically discover latent topics, and Node2Vec to capture structural relationships via a bipartite graph of legal documents. The embeddings are combined and clustered using KMeans, yielding coherent groupings of documents. Our computations on a legal document dataset demonstrate that the combined Top2Vec+Node2Vec approach improves clustering quality over text-only or graph-only embeddings. We conduct a sensitivity analysis of hyperparameters, such as the number of clusters and the dimensionality of the embeddings, and demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance against baseline Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) models. Key findings indicate that while the pipeline presents an innovative approach to unsupervised legal document analysis by combining semantic topic modeling with graph embedding techniques, its efficacy is contingent upon the quality of initial topic generation and the representational power of the chosen embedding models for specialized legal language. Strategic recommendations include the exploration of domain-specific embeddings, more comprehensive hyperparameter tuning for Node2Vec, dynamic determination of cluster numbers, and robust human-in-the-loop validation processes to enhance legal relevance and trustworthiness. The pipeline demonstrates potential for exploratory legal data analysis and as a precursor to supervised learning tasks but requires further refinement and domain-specific adaptation for practical legal applications.",

A total of 10 BIRADS and 26 morphological features were extracted from each lesion. A BIRADS, morphometric, and fused nomogram integrating both feature sets was constructed via logistic regression. Three radiologists (one senior, two general) and two ChatGPT variants independently interpreted deidentified breast lesion images. Diagnostic performance for biopsy recommendation (BIRADS 4,5) and malignancy prediction was assessed in internal and two external validation cohorts. In pooled analysis, the fused nomogram achieved the highest accuracy for biopsy recommendation (83.0%) and malignancy prediction (83.8%), outperforming the morphometric nomogram, three radiologists and both ChatGPT models. Its AUCs were 0.901 and 0.853 for the two tasks, respectively. In addition, the performance of the BIRADS nomogram was significantly higher than the morphometric nomogram, three radiologists and both ChatGPT models for biopsy recommendation and malignancy prediction. External validation confirmed the robust generalizability across different ultrasound platforms and populations. An integrated BIRADS morphometric nomogram consistently outperforms standalone models, LLMs, and radiologists in guiding biopsy decisions and predicting malignancy.

NLSPs are of importance as they are naturally connected to real-world applications. In an NLSP, one starts with a graph and arrives at a system of linear equations. The advantage that one may obtain with a QLS for an NLSP is determined by the interplay between three variables: the scaling of condition number and sparsity functions of matrices associated with the graphs considered, as well as the function describing the system size growth. We recommend graph families that can offer potential for an exponential advantage (best graph families) and those that offer sub-exponential but at least polynomial advantage (better graph families), with the HHL algorithm considered relative to the conjugate gradient (CG) method. Within the scope of our analyses, we observe that only 4 percent of the 50 considered graph families offer prospects for an exponential advantage, whereas about 20 percent of the considered graph families show a polynomial advantage. Furthermore, we observe and report some interesting cases where some graph families not only fare better with improved algorithms such as the Childs-Kothari-Somma algorithm but also graduate from offering no advantage to promising a polynomial advantage, graph families that exhibit futile exponential advantage, etc. Given the limited number of graph families that one can survey through numerical studies, we discuss an interesting case where we unify several graph families into one superfamily, and show the existence of infinite best and better graphs in it. Lastly, we very briefly touch upon some practical issues that one may face even if the aforementioned graph theoretic requirements are satisfied, including quantum hardware challenges.",

To address this, our framework integrates hierarchical system modelling with Bayesian probabilistic reasoning, constructing Bayesian Network Graphs from system architecture and vulnerability data. Models are encoded using a Domain Specific Language to enhance computational efficiency and support dynamic updates. In our approach, we use a hybrid exposure probability estimation framework, which combines Exploit Prediction Scoring System and Common Vulnerability Scoring System scores via Bayesian confidence calibration to handle epistemic uncertainty caused by incomplete or heterogeneous vulnerability metadata. Mitigation recommendations are generated as countermeasure portfolios, refined using multi-objective optimisation to identify Pareto-optimal strategies balancing attack likelihood, impact severity, and system availability. To accommodate time- and resource-constrained incident response, frequency-based heuristics are applied to prioritise countermeasures across the optimised portfolios. The framework was evaluated through three representative cyber-physical attack scenarios, demonstrating its versatility in handling complex adversarial behaviours under real-time response constraints. The results affirm its utility in operational contexts and highlight the robustness of our proposed approach across diverse threat environments.",

While prior work has extensively examined the security properties of the Android software stack, how these security properties hold for VR systems remains unexplored.

We collect over 300 versions of VR firmware from two major vendors, Quest and Pico, and perform a longitudinal analysis across the kernel layer, the system binary and library layer, and the application layer. We have identified several security issues in these VR firmware, including missing kernel-level security features, insufficient binary hardening, inconsistent permission enforcement, and inadequate SELinux policy enforcement. Based on our findings, we synthesize recommendations for VR vendors to improve security and trust for VR devices.

The framework leverages document hit rate and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) to optimize content for each learner, and is benchmarked against human-generated training for alignment and relevance. We demonstrate the framework in 4IR cybersecurity learning by creating a synthetic QA dataset emulating trainee behavior, while RAG is tuned on curated cybersecurity materials. Evaluation compares its generated training with manually curated queries representing realistic student interactions. Responses are produced using large language models (LLMs) including GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, assessed for faithfulness and content alignment. GPT-4 achieves the best performance with 87% relevancy and 100% alignment. Results show this dual-mode approach enables the adaptive tutor to act as both a personalized topic recommender and content generator, offering a scalable solution for rapid, tailored learning in 4IR education and workforce development.",

However, achieving precise depth and perforating at the correct location remains a significant challenge due to field operational constraints and equipment limitations. In this work, we propose the Dynamic Threshold and Physical Plausibility Depth Measurement and Perforation Control (DTPPMP) system, a solution integrated into perforating guns that enables real-time, precise depth measurement and perforation at designated perforating intervals. The system autonomously samples, processes and identifies signals from a casing collar locator (CCL) in situ within oil and gas wells. Casing collar identification is achieved using a lightweight dynamic threshold and physical plausibility algorithm deployed on an embedded platform, which serves as the system's processor. Field tests conducted in an actual oil well in Sichuan, China, demonstrated the DTPPMP's ability to accurately identify casing collar signals, measure depths, and effectively perforate at designated perforating intervals in real-time. The system achieved a perforation variation of less than the length of a single perforating interval and a F1 score of 98.6% for casing collar identification. These results provide valuable recommendations for advancing automation and intelligence in future perforation operations.",

We study multi-action partially observable restless multi-armed bandits, it is a generalization of the classical restless multi-armed bandit problem -- 1) each bandit has finite states, and the current state is not observable, 2) each bandit has finite actions. In particular, we assume that more than two actions are available for each bandit. We motivate our problem with the application of public-health intervention planning. We describe the model and formulate a long term discounted optimization problem, where the state of each bandit evolves according to a Markov process, and this evolution is action dependent. The state of a bandit is not observable but one of finitely many feedback signals are observable. Each bandit yields a reward, based on the action taken on that bandit. The agent is assumed to have a budget constraint. The bandits are assumed to be independent. However, they are weakly coupled at the agent through the budget constraint.   We first analyze the Lagrangian bound method for our partially observable restless bandits. The computation of optimal value functions for finite-state, finite-action POMDPs is non-trivial. Hence, the computation of Lagrangian bounds is also challenging. We describe approximations for the computation of Lagrangian bounds using point based value iteration (PBVI) and online rollout policy. We further present various properties of the value functions and provide theoretical insights on PBVI and online rollout policy. We study heuristic policies for multi-actions PORMAB. Finally, we discuss present Whittle index policies and their limitations in our model.",

These questions have troubled the mathematical community since the introduction of algebra into the Renaissance academy by men like Fran\\c{c}ois Vi\\`ete, Guillame Gosselin, and Ren\\'e Descartes. Their challenge is perhaps most starkly articulated at the conclusion of Vi\\`ete's Introduction to the Analytic Art, where he claims that his algebra \"appropriates to itself by right the proud problem of problems, which is: [sic] TO LEAVE NO PROBLEM UNSOLVED\".   Some contemporary educators respond by eschewing these methods to avoid the excessive formalization often accompanying algebra, and to give a central place to the geometrical tradition of Euclid's Elements. Others embrace the rise of algebra in the curriculum, focusing on contemporary techniques and priorities.   This paper seeks to reconcile these perspectives by clarifying the way in which algebra participates in the quadrivial arts. Based on testimony from both the origins of algebra and its contemporary practitioners, I argue that algebra is not so much an eighth liberal art as an arithmetical language of form; an actualized potential in arithmetic.

GPT-5 is a novel LLM system that has been specifically marketed towards oncology use.   Methods: Performance was assessed using two complementary benchmarks: (i) the ACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (TXIT, 2021), comprising 300 multiple-choice items, and (ii) a curated set of 60 authentic radiation oncologic vignettes representing diverse disease sites and treatment indications. For the vignette evaluation, GPT-5 was instructed to generate concise therapeutic plans. Four board-certified radiation oncologists rated correctness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations. Inter-rater reliability was quantified using Fleiss' \\k{appa}.   Results: On the TXIT benchmark, GPT-5 achieved a mean accuracy of 92.8%, outperforming GPT-4 (78.8%) and GPT-3.5 (62.1%). Domain-specific gains were most pronounced in Dose and Diagnosis. In the vignette evaluation, GPT-5's treatment recommendations were rated highly for correctness (mean 3.24/4, 95% CI: 3.11-3.38) and comprehensiveness (3.59/4, 95% CI: 3.49-3.69). Hallucinations were rare with no case reaching majority consensus for their presence. Inter-rater agreement was low (Fleiss' \\k{appa} 0.083 for correctness), reflecting inherent variability in clinical judgment. Errors clustered in complex scenarios requiring precise trial knowledge or detailed clinical adaptation.   Discussion: GPT-5 clearly outperformed prior model variants on the radiation oncology multiple-choice benchmark. Although GPT-5 exhibited favorable performance in generating real-world radiation oncology treatment recommendations, correctness ratings indicate room for further improvement. While hallucinations were infrequent, the presence of substantive errors underscores that GPT-5-generated recommendations require rigorous expert oversight before clinical implementation.",

We then propose two algorithms: (i) a learning-augmented approach that improves upon expert recommendations at any single-step; and (ii) a greedy algorithm for multi-step planning, both with strong worst-case approximation estimation.

This paper is the first to address this gap by providing recommendations for designing and evaluating model stealing attacks. To this end, we study the largest group of attacks that rely on training a substitute model -- those attacking image classification models. We propose the first comprehensive threat model and develop a framework for attack comparison. Further, we analyse attack setups from related works to understand which tasks and models have been studied the most. Based on our findings, we present best practices for attack development before, during, and beyond experiments and derive an extensive list of open research questions regarding the evaluation of model stealing attacks. Our findings and recommendations also transfer to other problem domains, hence establishing the first generic evaluation methodology for model stealing attacks.",

We propose a novel problem formulation, analyze various minimization techniques, and investigate key factors influencing their effectiveness. We demonstrate that substantial inference data reduction is technically feasible without significant performance loss. However, its practicality is critically determined by two factors: the technical setting (e.g., performance targets, choice of model) and user characteristics (e.g., history size, preference complexity). Thus, while we establish its technical feasibility, we conclude that data minimization remains practically challenging and its dependence on the technical and user context makes a universal standard for data `necessity' difficult to implement.",

We study the performance of the estimator in a set of simulations designed to closely match several commonly studied real data sets. We find that there is substantial variation in the performance of the estimators across the settings considered. The proposed estimator outperforms two-way-fixed-effect/difference-in-differences, synthetic control, matrix completion and synthetic-difference-in-differences estimators. We investigate what features of the data generating process lead to this performance, and assess the relative importance of the three components of the proposed estimator. We have two recommendations. Our preferred strategy is that researchers use simulations closely matched to the data they are interested in, along the lines discussed in this paper, to investigate which estimators work well in their particular setting. A simpler approach is to use more robust estimators such as synthetic difference-in-differences or the new triply robust panel estimator which we find to substantially outperform two-way fixed effect estimators in many empirically relevant settings.",

However, most of the existing CTR prediction methods are mainly based on the ID modality. As a result, they are unable to comprehensively model users' multi-modal preferences. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce multi-modal CTR prediction. Although it seems appealing to directly apply the existing multi-modal fusion methods to click-through rate prediction models, these methods (1) fail to effectively disentangle commonalities and specificities across different modalities; (2) fail to consider the synergistic effects between modalities and model the complex interactions between modalities.   To address the above issues, this paper proposes the Diffusion-based Multi-modal Synergy Interest Network (Diff-MSIN) framework for click-through prediction. This framework introduces three innovative modules: the Multi-modal Feature Enhancement (MFE) Module Synergistic Relationship Capture (SRC) Module, and the Feature Dynamic Adaptive Fusion (FDAF) Module. The MFE Module and SRC Module extract synergistic, common, and special information among different modalities. They effectively enhances the representation of the modalities, improving the overall quality of the fusion. To encourage distinctiveness among different features, we design a Knowledge Decoupling method. Additionally, the FDAF Module focuses on capturing user preferences and reducing fusion noise. To validate the effectiveness of the Diff-MSIN framework, we conducted extensive experiments using the Rec-Tmall and three Amazon datasets. The results demonstrate that our approach yields a significant improvement of at least 1.67% compared to the baseline, highlighting its potential for enhancing multi-modal recommendation systems.

This paper demonstrates how Project-Based Learning (PBL) can be leveraged to bridge that gap. This can be done by engaging students in a real-world, interdisciplinary task that combines quantum computing with their field of interest. As part of a similar assignment, we investigated the application of the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm for computed tomography (CT) image reconstruction and benchmarked its performance against the classical Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART). Through implementing and analyzing both methods on a small-scale problem, we gained practical experience with quantum algorithms, critically evaluated their limitations, and developed technical writing and research skills. The experience demonstrated that Project-Based Learning not only enhances conceptual understanding but also encourages students to engage deeply with emerging technologies through research, implementation, and reflection. We recommend the integration of similar PBL modules in introductory quantum computing courses. The assignment also works better if students are required to write and submit a conference-style paper, supported by mentorship from faculty across the different fields. In such course interdisciplinary, real-world problems can transform abstract theory into meaningful learning experiences and better prepare students for future advancements in quantum technologies.",

We identified three CA functions: School, Discovery, Entertainment, and derived ``recipe'' scaffolds mirroring parent-child support. In Study 2, we prompted GPT-4o-mini on 1,200 simulated child-CA exchanges, comparing conversation-tree recipes based on structured-prompting to an unstructured baseline. Quantitative evaluation of readability, question count/depth/diversity, and coherence revealed gains for the recipe approach. Building on these findings, we offer design recommendations: scaffolded conversation-trees, child-dedicated profiles for personalized context, and caregiver-curated content.

This limits search coverage in ways that are not visible to users. Using six models and two datasets, we compare search strategies and quantify both performance variance and search path instability. Our findings reveal that hidden framework logic can introduce variability comparable to the differences between search strategies.

With recent advances in AI models and hardware, EAI systems are becoming increasingly capable across wider operational domains. While EAI systems can offer many benefits, they also pose significant risks, including physical harm from malicious use, mass surveillance, as well as economic and societal disruption. These risks require urgent attention from policymakers, as existing policies governing industrial robots and autonomous vehicles are insufficient to address the full range of concerns EAI systems present. To help address this issue, this paper makes three contributions. First, we provide a taxonomy of the physical, informational, economic, and social risks EAI systems pose. Second, we analyze policies in the US, EU, and UK to assess how existing frameworks address these risks and to identify critical gaps. We conclude by offering policy recommendations for the safe and beneficial deployment of EAI systems, such as mandatory testing and certification schemes, clarified liability frameworks, and strategies to manage EAI's potentially transformative economic and societal impacts.",

OneRec reformulates recommendation as an autoregressive generation task, achieving high Model FLOPs Utilization.

To address this, we propose SUMMA (the abbreviation of Summarizing MultiModal Ads), a multimodal model that automatically processes video ads into summaries highlighting the content of highest commercial value, thus improving their comprehension and ranking in Douyin search-advertising systems. SUMMA is developed via a two-stage training strategy-multimodal supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning with a mixed reward mechanism-on domain-specific data containing video frames and ASR/OCR transcripts, generating commercially valuable and explainable summaries. We integrate SUMMA-generated summaries into our production pipeline, directly enhancing the candidate retrieval and relevance ranking stages in real search-advertising systems. Both offline and online experiments show substantial improvements over baselines, with online results indicating a statistically significant 1.5% increase in advertising revenue.

The taxonomy offers industry practitioners a quick checklist for selecting robust methods and gives researchers a clear roadmap to the field's most urgent gaps. Examples include the shortage of shared simulators, varying evaluation metrics, and the fact that most studies report either fairness or performance; only six use both.",

However, algorithms often unintentionally direct tourist streams in a way that negatively affects the environment, local communities, or other stakeholders. This issue can be partly attributed to the computer science community's limited understanding of the complex relationships and trade-offs among stakeholders in the real world.   In this work, we draw on the practical findings and methods from tourism management to inform research on multistakeholder fairness in algorithmic decision-support. Leveraging a semi-systematic literature review, we synthesize literature from tourism management as well as literature from computer science. Our findings suggest that tourism management actively tries to identify the specific needs of stakeholders and utilizes qualitative, inclusive and participatory methods to study fairness from a normative and holistic research perspective. In contrast, computer science lacks sufficient understanding of the stakeholder needs and primarily considers fairness through descriptive factors, such as measureable discrimination, while heavily relying on few mathematically formalized fairness criteria that fail to capture the multidimensional nature of fairness in tourism.   With the results of this work, we aim to illustrate the shortcomings of purely algorithmic research and stress the potential and particular need for future interdisciplinary collaboration. We believe such a collaboration is a fundamental and necessary step to enhance algorithmic decision-support systems towards understanding and supporting true multistakeholder fairness in tourism.",

Our modular pipeline supports configurable recommendation domains and sensitive attributes, enabling systematic and flexible audits of any open-source LLM. Through evaluations of state-of-the-art models (Gemma 3 and Llama 3.2), we uncover consistent biases across recommendation domains (music, movies, and colleges) including gendered and cultural stereotypes.

            "abstract": "Modern industrial recommendation systems encounter a core challenge of multi-stage optimization misalignment: a significant semantic gap exists between the multi-objective optimization paradigm widely used in the ranking phase and the single-objective modeling in the retrieve phase. Although the mainstream industry solution achieves multi-objective coverage through parallel multi-path single-objective retrieval, this approach leads to linear growth of training and serving resources with the number of objectives and has inherent limitations in handling loosely coupled objectives. This paper proposes the MPFormer, a dynamic multi-task Transformer framework, which systematically addresses the aforementioned issues through three innovative mechanisms. First, an objective-conditioned transformer that jointly encodes user behavior sequences and multi-task semantics through learnable attention modulation; second, personalized target weights are introduced to achieve dynamic adjustment of retrieval results; finally, user personalization information is incorporated into token representations and the Transformer structure to further enhance the model's representation ability. This framework has been successfully integrated into Kuaishou short video recommendation system, stably serving over 400 million daily active users. It significantly improves user daily engagement and system operational efficiency. Practical deployment verification shows that, compared with traditional solutions, it effectively optimizes the iterative paradigm of multi-objective retrieval while maintaining service response speed, providing a scalable multi-objective solution for industrial recommendation systems.",

Airbnb has historically relied on structured data to understand, rank, and recommend listings to guests due to the limited capabilities and associated complexity arising from extracting meaningful information from text and images. With the rise of representation learning, leveraging rich information from text and photos has become easier. A popular approach has been to create embeddings for text documents and images to enable use cases of computing similarities between listings or using embeddings as features in an ML model.   However, an Airbnb listing has diverse unstructured data: multiple images, various unstructured text documents such as title, description, and reviews, making this approach challenging. Specifically, it is a non-trivial task to combine multiple embeddings of different pieces of information to reach a single representation.   This paper proposes BiListing, for Bimodal Listing, an approach to align text and photos of a listing by leveraging large-language models and pretrained language-image models. The BiListing approach has several favorable characteristics: capturing unstructured data into a single embedding vector per listing and modality, enabling zero-shot capability to search inventory efficiently in user-friendly semantics, overcoming the cold start problem, and enabling listing-to-listing search along a single modality, or both.   We conducted offline and online tests to leverage the BiListing embeddings in the Airbnb search ranking model, and successfully deployed it in production, achieved 0.425% of NDCB gain, and drove tens of millions in incremental revenue.",

We further document affective signal extraction techniques, system architectures, and application areas, highlighting key trends, limitations, and open challenges. As future research directions, we emphasize hybrid models that leverage multiple types of affective states across different modalities, the development of large-scale affect-aware datasets, and the need to replace the folk vocabulary of affective states with a more precise terminology grounded in cognitive and social psychology.

            "abstract": "Participatory AI, in which impacted community members and other stakeholders are involved in the design and development of AI systems, holds promise as a way to ensure AI is developed to meet their needs and reflect their values. However, the process of identifying, reaching out, and engaging with all relevant stakeholder groups, which we refer to as recruitment methodology, is still a practical challenge in AI projects striving to adopt participatory practices. In this paper, we investigate the challenges that researchers face when designing and executing recruitment methodology for Participatory AI projects, and the implications of current recruitment practice for Participatory AI. First, we describe the recruitment methodologies used in AI projects using a corpus of 37 projects to capture the diversity of practices in the field and perform an initial analysis on the documentation of recruitment practices, as well as specific strategies that researchers use to meet goals of equity and empowerment. To complement this analysis, we interview five AI researchers to learn about the outcomes of recruitment methodologies. We find that these outcomes are shaped by structural conditions of their work, researchers' own goals and expectations, and the relationships built from the recruitment methodology and subsequent collaboration. Based on these analyses, we provide recommendations for designing and executing relationship-forward recruitment methods, as well as reflexive recruitment documentation practices for Participatory AI researchers.",

We impose a $z$-band magnitude cut of < 20 in AB magnitude. We deploy a Residual Neural Network and EfficientNet as an ensemble trained on a compilation of known lensing systems and high-grade candidates as well as nonlenses in the same footprint. The predictions from these two base models are aggregated using a meta-learner. After applying our ensemble to the survey data, we exclude known candidates and systems, and use our own visual inspection portal to rank images in the top 0.01 percentile of all neural network recommendations. We have found 811 new lens candidates. These include 484 new candidates in the Legacy Surveys DR9 footprint, all parts of which have been searched for strong lenses at least once before, either by our group or others.

By learning and analyzing these preferences and residuals, it develops a personalized recommendation strategy for each user and simultaneously detects anomalies.

            "abstract": "Cataract surgery remains one of the most widely performed and effective procedures for vision restoration. Effective surgical planning requires integrating diverse clinical examinations for patient assessment, intraocular lens (IOL) selection, and risk evaluation. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in supporting clinical decision-making. However, existing LLMs often lack the domain-specific expertise to interpret heterogeneous ophthalmic data and provide actionable surgical plans. To enhance the model's ability to interpret heterogeneous ophthalmic reports, we propose a knowledge-driven Multi-Agent System (MAS), where each agent simulates the reasoning process of specialist ophthalmologists, converting raw clinical inputs into structured, actionable summaries in both training and deployment stages. Building on MAS, we introduce CataractSurg-80K, the first large-scale benchmark for cataract surgery planning that incorporates structured clinical reasoning. Each case is annotated with diagnostic questions, expert reasoning chains, and structured surgical recommendations. We further introduce Qwen-CSP, a domain-specialized model built on Qwen-4B, fine-tuned through a multi-stage process tailored for surgical planning. Comprehensive experiments show that Qwen-CSP outperforms strong general-purpose LLMs across multiple metrics. Our work delivers a high-quality dataset, a rigorous benchmark, and a domain-adapted LLM to facilitate future research in medical AI reasoning and decision support.",

However, the application of health agents to fulfill the diverse needs of individuals in daily non-clinical settings is underexplored. In this work, we aim to build a comprehensive personal health agent that is able to reason about multimodal data from everyday consumer wellness devices and common personal health records, and provide personalized health recommendations. To understand end-users' needs when interacting with such an assistant, we conducted an in-depth analysis of web search and health forum queries, alongside qualitative insights from users and health experts gathered through a user-centered design process. Based on these findings, we identified three major categories of consumer health needs, each of which is supported by a specialist sub-agent: (1) a data science agent that analyzes personal time-series wearable and health record data, (2) a health domain expert agent that integrates users' health and contextual data to generate accurate, personalized insights, and (3) a health coach agent that synthesizes data insights, guiding users using a specified psychological strategy and tracking users' progress. Furthermore, we propose and develop the Personal Health Agent (PHA), a multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, personalized interactions to address individual health needs. To evaluate each sub-agent and the multi-agent system, we conducted automated and human evaluations across 10 benchmark tasks, involving more than 7,000 annotations and 1,100 hours of effort from health experts and end-users. Our work represents the most comprehensive evaluation of a health agent to date and establishes a strong foundation towards the futuristic vision of a personal health agent accessible to everyone.",

            "abstract": "According to some standards for satellite communications, the transmitted stream is divided into transmission units with variable length, for which detecting the termination is particularly relevant. This is the case of space TeleCommands (TCs), where coded data are usually preceded by a start sequence, and optionally followed by a tail sequence, forming the Communication Link Transmission Unit (CLTU). Regarding the choice of schemes for error correction, the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems recommendations for TC synchronization and coding suggests to use, among others, two Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes: one (relatively) long and one short. Adopting the long LDPC code eliminates the need for a tail sequence, as the LDPC decoder always fails when overrunning the end of the CLTU, thus causing the decoding and detection process to stop. This, however, is not true when the short LDPC code is adopted, since its decoding might converge on a codeword even when the decoder input is not a noisy codeword. This makes it necessary to use a tail sequence that causes the decoder to fail regardless of its input. In this paper, we study the features required for such a sequence and propose some methods for its design. Our numerical results, obtained considering various detection approaches for the tail sequence, show that the overall TC rejection probability improves significantly when the proposed tail sequence is employed. Our simulations also show that, for moderate values of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), with a properly designed tail sequence it is possible to obtain the same performance in terms of TC rejection probability using decoder-based detection and likelihood ratio test-based detection, with the former approach being less complex than the latter.",

Recommendations and outcomes are public, and clients' implementation effort depends on current reputation. In a recursive, belief-based equilibrium: (i) advice follows a cutoff in the signal; (ii) under a simple diagnosticity asymmetry, the cutoff is (weakly) increasing in reputation (reputational conservatism); and (iii) comparative statics are transparent - higher signal precision or a higher success prior lowers the cutoff, whereas stronger career concerns raise it. A success-contingent bonus implements any target experimentation rate via a closed-form mapping. The model predicts that high-reputation analysts make fewer risky calls yet attain higher conditional hit rates, and it clarifies how committee thresholds and monitoring regimes shift behavior.",

            "abstract": "Extending recommender systems to federated learning (FL) frameworks to protect the privacy of users or platforms while making recommendations has recently gained widespread attention in academia. This is due to the natural coupling of recommender systems and federated learning architectures: the data originates from distributed clients (mostly mobile devices held by users), which are highly related to privacy. In a centralized recommender system (CenRec), the central server collects clients' data, trains the model, and provides the service. Whereas in federated recommender systems (FedRec), the step of data collecting is omitted, and the step of model training is offloaded to each client. The server only aggregates the model and other knowledge, thus avoiding client privacy leakage. Some surveys of federated recommender systems discuss and analyze related work from the perspective of designing FL systems. However, their utility drops by ignoring specific recommendation scenarios' unique characteristics and practical challenges. For example, the statistical heterogeneity issue in cross-domain FedRec originates from the label drift of the data held by different platforms, which is mainly caused by the recommender itself, but not the federated architecture. Therefore, it should focus more on solving specific problems in real-world recommendation scenarios to encourage the deployment FedRec. To this end, this review comprehensively analyzes the coupling of recommender systems and federated learning from the perspective of recommendation researchers and practitioners. We establish a clear link between recommendation scenarios and FL frameworks, systematically analyzing scenario-specific approaches, practical challenges, and potential opportunities. We aim to develop guidance for the real-world deployment of FedRec, bridging the gap between existing research and applications.",

This lack of timely information, coupled with limited infrastructure in rural areas, significantly increases the risk of crashes. Although various sensing technologies exist to monitor individual hazards like low visibility or surface friction, they rarely assess the combined driving risk posed by multiple simultaneous hazards, nor do they provide actionable recommendations such as safe advisory speeds. To address this critical gap, in this study, we present a roadway hazard risk assessment framework that provides an approach to quantify the probability and severity of crash occurrences due to specific roadway hazards. To evaluate this framework, we presented a case study by constructing a synthetic \"year-long\" dataset that encompasses every possible pairing of road surface and visibility conditions. Our analysis confirms that the combined ProbabilitySeverity scoring yields a coherent, stepwise risk profile across all hazard scenarios. These results validate the practicality of our risk assessment approach and provide a foundation for deploying graduated safety measures in real-world roadway operations.",

However, despite proven utility in other fields, these metrics have not been compared to human readability judgments in PLS. We evaluate 8 readability metrics and show that most correlate poorly with human judgments, including the most popular metric, FKGL. We then show that Language Models (LMs) are better judges of readability, with the best-performing model achieving a Pearson correlation of 0.56 with human judgments. Extending our analysis to PLS datasets, which contain summaries aimed at non-expert audiences, we find that LMs better capture deeper measures of readability, such as required background knowledge, and lead to different conclusions than the traditional metrics.

For secondary school teachers, who may lack time or relevant knowledge, honing students' understanding of debugging can be a daunting task. Despite this, little research has explored their perspectives of debugging. To this end, we investigated secondary teachers' experiences of debugging in the classroom, with a focus on text-based programming. Through thematic analysis of nine semi-structured interviews, we identified a common reliance on the teacher for debugging support, often embodied by many raised hands. We call this phenomenon the `hands-up problem'. While more experienced and confident teachers discussed strategies they use for dealing with this, less confident teachers discussed the generally negative consequences of this problem. We recommend further research into debugging-specific pedagogical content knowledge and professional development to help less confident teachers develop counters to the hands-up problem.",

However, little is known about how open-source projects use and customize these tools. Aims: This paper investigates how GitHub projects use and customize a popular SCA tool, namely SonarQube Cloud. Method: We conducted a mining study of GitHub projects that are linked through GitHub Actions to SonarQube Cloud projects. Results: Among 321 GitHub projects using SonarQube Cloud, 81% of them are correctly connected to SonarQube Cloud projects, while others exhibit misconfigurations or restricted access. Among 265 accessible SonarQube Cloud projects, 75% use the organization's default quality gate, i.e., a set of conditions that deployed source code must meet to pass automated checks. While 55% of the projects use the built-in quality gate provided by SonarQube Cloud, 45% of them customize their quality gate with different conditions. Overall, the most common quality conditions align with SonarQube Cloud's \"Clean as You Code\" principle and enforce security, maintainability, reliability, coverage, and a few duplicates on newly added or modified source code. Conclusions: Many projects rely on predefined configurations, yet a significant portion customize their configurations to meet specific quality goals. Building on our initial results, we envision a future research agenda linking quality gate configurations to actual software outcomes (e.g., improvement of software security). This would enable evidence-based recommendations for configuring SCA tools like SonarQube Cloud in various contexts.",

Current large language model (LLM)-based agents inherit these shortcomings through their overreliance on heuristic pattern matching, yielding recommendations prone to shallow correlation bias, limited causal inference, and brittleness in sparse-data scenarios. We introduce STARec, a slow-thinking augmented agent framework that endows recommender systems with autonomous deliberative reasoning capabilities. Each user is modeled as an agent with parallel cognitions: fast response for immediate interactions and slow reasoning that performs chain-of-thought rationales. To cultivate intrinsic slow thinking, we develop anchored reinforcement training - a two-stage paradigm combining structured knowledge distillation from advanced reasoning models with preference-aligned reward shaping. This hybrid approach scaffolds agents in acquiring foundational capabilities (preference summarization, rationale generation) while enabling dynamic policy adaptation through simulated feedback loops. Experiments on MovieLens 1M and Amazon CDs benchmarks demonstrate that STARec achieves substantial performance gains compared with state-of-the-art baselines, despite using only 0.4% of the full training data.",

Not every species is detected equally well, yet underlying causes remain unclear. We address two key research questions: 1) What factors beyond data quantity drive class-specific performance disparities? 2) How can we systematically improve detection of under-performing marine species? We manipulate the DUO dataset to separate the object detection task into localization and classification and investigate the under-performance of the scallop class. Localization analysis using YOLO11 and TIDE finds that foreground-background discrimination is the most problematic stage regardless of data quantity. Classification experiments reveal persistent precision gaps even with balanced data, indicating intrinsic feature-based challenges beyond data scarcity and inter-class dependencies. We recommend imbalanced distributions when prioritizing precision, and balanced distributions when prioritizing recall. Improving under-performing classes should focus on algorithmic advances, especially within localization modules. We publicly release our code and datasets.",

This need is especially pronounced with Asynchronous Many-Task (AMT) systems. This communication pattern was not a consideration during the design of the original MPI specification. The MPI community has recently introduced several extensions to address these evolving requirements. This work evaluates two such extensions, the Virtual Communication Interface (VCI) and the Continuation extensions, in the context of an established AMT runtime HPX. We begin by using an MPI-level microbenchmark, modeled from HPX's low-level communication mechanism, to measure the peak performance potential of these extensions. We then integrate them into HPX to evaluate their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Our results show that while these extensions can enhance performance compared to standard MPI, areas for improvement remain. The current continuation proposal limits the maximum multithreaded message rate achievable in the multi-VCI setting. Furthermore, the recommended one-VCI-per-thread mode proves ineffective in real-world systems due to the attentiveness problem. These findings underscore the importance of improving intra-VCI threading efficiency to achieve scalable multithreaded communication and fully realize the benefits of recent MPI extensions.",

However, the current methods for ranking and recommending apps in these stores mostly rely on static metrics like user activity and favorites, which makes it hard for users to efficiently find high-quality apps. To address these challenges, we propose LaQual, an automated framework for evaluating the quality of LLM apps. LaQual consists of three main stages: first, it labels and classifies LLM apps in a hierarchical way to accurately match them to different scenarios; second, it uses static indicators, such as time-weighted user engagement and functional capability metrics, to filter out low-quality apps; and third, it conducts a dynamic, scenario-adaptive evaluation, where the LLM itself generates scenario-specific evaluation metrics, scoring rules, and tasks for a thorough quality assessment. Experiments on a popular LLM app store show that LaQual is effective. Its automated scores are highly consistent with human judgments (with Spearman's rho of 0.62 and p=0.006 in legal consulting, and rho of 0.60 and p=0.009 in travel planning). By effectively screening, LaQual can reduce the pool of candidate LLM apps by 66.7% to 81.3%. User studies further confirm that LaQual significantly outperforms baseline systems in decision confidence, comparison efficiency (with average scores of 5.45 compared to 3.30), and the perceived value of its evaluation reports (4.75 versus 2.25). Overall, these results demonstrate that LaQual offers a scalable, objective, and user-centered solution for finding and recommending high-quality LLM apps in real-world use cases.",

The recently proposed $(\\alpha, \\beta)$-dense subgraph model has demonstrated superior capability in capturing the intrinsic density structure of bipartite graphs compared to existing alternatives. However, despite its modeling advantages, the $(\\alpha, \\beta)$-dense subgraph model lacks efficient support for query processing and dynamic updates, limiting its practical utility in large-scale applications. To address these limitations, we propose BD-Index, a novel index that answers $(\\alpha, \\beta)$-dense subgraph queries in optimal time while using only linear space $O(|E|)$, making it well-suited for real-world applications requiring both fast query processing and low memory consumption. We further develop two complementary maintenance strategies for dynamic bipartite graphs to support efficient updates to the BD-Index. The space-efficient strategy updates the index in time complexity of $O(p \\cdot |E|^{1.5})$ per edge insertion or deletion, while maintaining a low space cost of $O(|E|)$ (the same as the index itself), where $p$ is typically a small constant in real-world graphs. In contrast, the time-efficient strategy significantly reduces the update time to $O(p \\cdot |E|)$ per edge update by maintaining auxiliary orientation structures, at the cost of increased memory usage up to $O(p \\cdot |E|)$. These two strategies provide flexible trade-offs between maintenance efficiency and memory usage, enabling BD-Index to adapt to diverse application requirements. Extensive experiments on 10 large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate high efficiency and scalability of our proposed solutions.",

Despite their practicality, such evaluations build upon a strong assumption: that OOD evaluations can capture and reflect upon possible failures in a real-world deployment.   In this work, we challenge this assumption and confront the results obtained from OOD evaluations with a set of specific failure modes documented in existing question-answering (QA) models, referred to as a reliance on spurious features or prediction shortcuts.   We find that different datasets used for OOD evaluations in QA provide an estimate of models' robustness to shortcuts that have a vastly different quality, some largely under-performing even a simple, in-distribution evaluation. We partially attribute this to the observation that spurious shortcuts are shared across ID+OOD datasets, but also find cases where a dataset's quality for training and evaluation is largely disconnected. Our work underlines limitations of commonly-used OOD-based evaluations of generalization, and provides methodology and recommendations for evaluating generalization within and beyond QA more robustly.",

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) and existing preference optimization techniques perform well on standard benchmarks, they often struggle to differentiate between physically valid and invalid reasoning. This shortcoming becomes critical in high-stakes applications like metal joining, where seemingly plausible yet physically incorrect recommendations can lead to defects, material waste, equipment damage, and serious safety risks. To address this challenge, we introduce PKG-DPO, a novel framework that integrates Physics Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enforce physical validity in AI-generated outputs. PKG-DPO comprises three key components A) hierarchical physics knowledge graph that encodes cross-domain relationships, conservation laws, and thermodynamic principles. B) A physics reasoning engine that leverages structured knowledge to improve discrimination between physically consistent and inconsistent responses. C) A physics-grounded evaluation suite designed to assess compliance with domain-specific constraints. PKG-DPO achieves 17% fewer constraint violations and an 11% higher Physics Score compared to KG-DPO (knowledge graph-based DPO). Additionally, PKG-DPO demonstrates a 12\\% higher relevant parameter accuracy and a 7% higher quality alignment in reasoning accuracy.

Most existing LLM/LVLMs can explain generic sports activities, but lack sufficient domain-centric sports' jargon to create natural (human-like) descriptions. This work highlights the limitations of existing SoTA LLM/LVLMs for generating production-grade sports captions from images in a desired stylized format, and proposes a two-level fine-tuned LVLM pipeline to address that. The proposed pipeline yields an improvement > 8-10% in the F1, and > 2-10% in BERT score compared to alternative approaches. In addition, it has a small runtime memory footprint and fast execution time.

Users face difficulty sifting through a vast number of discrete insights to integrate specific ones into a unified narrative that meets their analytical goals. Existing methods either heavily rely on user expertise, making the process inefficient, or employ automated approaches that cannot fully capture their evolving goals. In this paper, we introduce InReAcTable, a framework that enhances visual data story construction by establishing both structural and semantic connections between data insights. Each user interaction triggers the Acting module, which utilizes an insight graph for structural filtering to narrow the search space, followed by the Reasoning module using the retrieval-augmented generation method based on large language models for semantic filtering, ultimately providing insight recommendations aligned with the user's analytical intent. Based on the InReAcTable framework, we develop an interactive prototype system that guides users to construct visual data stories aligned with their analytical requirements. We conducted a case study and a user experiment to demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of the InReAcTable framework and the prototype system for interactively building visual data stories.",

At the core of the AI Data Scientist is a team of specialized LLM Subagents, each responsible for a distinct task such as data cleaning, statistical testing, validation, and plain-language communication. These Subagents write their own code, reason about causality, and identify when additional data is needed to support sound conclusions. Together, they achieve in minutes what might otherwise take days or weeks, enabling a new kind of interaction that makes deep data science both accessible and actionable.",

We introduce HyST (Hybrid retrieval over Semi-structured Tabular data), a hybrid retrieval framework that combines LLM-powered structured filtering with semantic embedding search to support complex information needs over semi-structured tabular data. HyST extracts attribute-level constraints from natural language using large language models (LLMs) and applies them as metadata filters, while processing the remaining unstructured query components via embedding-based retrieval. Experiments on a semi-structured benchmark show that HyST consistently outperforms tradtional baselines, highlighting the importance of structured filtering in improving retrieval precision, offering a scalable and accurate solution for real-world user queries.",

            "abstract": "Shocks are promising sites of particle acceleration in extragalactic jets. In electron-ion shocks, electrons can be heated up to large Lorentz factors, making them an attractive scenario to explain the high minimum electron Lorentz factors regularly needed to describe the emission of BL Lac objects. Still, the thermal electron component is commonly neglected when modelling the observations, although it holds key informations on the shock properties. We model the broadband emission of the HSP blazar Mrk421 employing particle distributions that include a thermal relativistic Maxwellian component at low energies followed by a nonthermal power-law, as motivated by PIC simulations. The observations in the optical/UV and MeV-GeV bands efficiently restrict the nonthermal emission from the Maxwellian electrons, which we use to derive constraints on the basic properties, such as the fraction $\\epsilon_e$ of the total shock energy stored in the nonthermal electrons. The best-fit model yields a nonthermal electron power-law with an index of ~2.4, close to predictions from shock acceleration. Successful fits are obtained when the ratio between the Lorentz factor at which the nonthermal distribution begins ($\\gamma_{\\rm nth}$) and the dimensionless electron temperature ($\\theta$) satisfies $\\gamma_{\\rm nth}/\\theta \\lesssim 8$. Since $\\gamma_{\\rm nth}/\\theta$ controls $\\epsilon_e$, the latter limit implies that at least $\\epsilon_e \\approx 10\\%$ of the shock energy is transferred to the nonthermal electrons. These results are almost insensitive to the shock velocity $\\gamma_{\\rm sh}$, but radio observations indicate $\\gamma_{\\rm sh} \\gtrsim 5$ since for lower shock velocities the radio fluxes are overproduced by the Maxwellian electrons. If shocks drive the particle energisation, our findings indicate that they operate in the mildly to fully relativistic regime with efficient electron acceleration.",

This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of MCR automation research, aiming to characterize the field's evolution, formalize learning tasks, highlight methodological challenges, and offer actionable recommendations to guide future research. Focusing on the primary code review tasks, we systematically surveyed 691 publications and identified 24 relevant studies published between May 2015 and April 2024. Each study was analyzed in terms of tasks, models, metrics, baselines, results, validity concerns, and artifact availability. In particular, our analysis reveals significant potential for standardization, including 48 task metric combinations, 22 of which were unique to their original paper, and limited dataset reuse. We highlight challenges and derive concrete recommendations for examples such as the temporal bias threat, which are rarely addressed so far.

            "abstract": "Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) plays a crucial role in many key areas. Proximity graphs (PGs) are the leading method for ANNS, offering the best balance between query efficiency and accuracy. However, their performance heavily depends on various construction and query parameters, which are difficult to optimize due to their complex inter-dependencies. Given that users often prioritize specific accuracy levels, efficiently identifying the optimal PG configurations to meet these targets is essential. Although some studies have explored automatic configuration tuning for PGs, they are limited by inefficiencies and suboptimal results. These issues stem from the need to construct numerous PGs for searching and re-tuning from scratch whenever the dataset changes, as well as the failure to capture the complex dependencies between configurations, query performance, and tuning objectives.   To address these challenges, we propose PGTuner, an efficient framework for automatic PG configuration tuning leveraging pre-training knowledge and model transfer techniques. PGTuner improves efficiency through a pre-trained query performance prediction (QPP) model, eliminating the need to build multiple PGs. It also features a deep reinforcement learning-based parameter configuration recommendation (PCR) model to recommend optimal configurations for specific datasets and accuracy targets. Additionally, PGTuner incorporates out-of-distribution detection and deep active learning for efficient tuning in dynamic scenarios and transferring to new datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PGTuner can stably achieve the top-level tuning effect across different datasets while significantly improving tuning efficiency by up to 14.69X, with a 14.64X boost in dynamic scenarios. The code and data for PGTuner are available online at https://github.com/hao-duan/PGTuner.",

In addition, if chemical equilibrium holds, then simple analytical solutions can be formulated. These have particular advantages in the application to complex models evolving over multi-point spatial grids. In this study, the equilibrium solutions to highly simplified chemical networks for CO and H2O have been re-assessed with particular attention to the formulation of the ice desorption rates in the context of 'three-phase' gas-grain astrochemical models. The analytical solutions have also been updated to account for the chemically inert reservoir of molecules below the surface ice layers, and to include the effects of reactive desorption. We find that a very close match is obtained to the results from detailed three-phase models of the time-dependent astrochemistry, and the abundances are typically accurate to within a factor of two over the entire range of densities and extinction that are applicable to dense clouds and young star-forming regions. In addition, these solutions give accurate results over most of the range of conditions even for systems undergoing rapid dynamical evolution. Although there are some caveats of applicability, we therefore recommend that these solutions be used in models of cold molecular environments where the rapid calculation of the abundances of CO, H2O and atomic coolants is helpful.",

However, evaluating serendipitous performance remains challenging because its ground truth is generally unobservable. The existing offline metrics often depend on ambiguous definitions or are tailored to specific datasets and RSs, thereby limiting their generalizability. To address this issue, we propose a universally applicable evaluation framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) known for their extensive knowledge and reasoning capabilities, as evaluators. First, to improve the evaluation performance of the proposed framework, we assessed the serendipity prediction accuracy of LLMs using four different prompt strategies on a dataset containing user-annotated serendipitous ground truth and found that the chain-of-thought prompt achieved the highest accuracy. Next, we re-evaluated the serendipitous performance of both serendipity-oriented and general RSs using the proposed framework on three commonly used real-world datasets, without the ground truth. The results indicated that there was no serendipity-oriented RS that consistently outperformed across all datasets, and even a general RS sometimes achieved higher performance than the serendipity-oriented RS.",

All the possible patterns of comparisons resulting in a connected representing graph were evaluated against the complete data based on 301 individual's pairwise comparison matrices (PCMs) using the logarithmic least squares weight calculation technique. It is shown that the empirical results, i.e., the empirical distributions of the elements of PCMs, are quite similar to the former simulated outcomes from the literature. The obtained empirically optimal patterns of comparisons were the best or the second best in the former simulations as well, while the sequence of comparisons that contains the most (close to) optimal patterns is exactly the same.

Its education remains limited by the lack of qualified instructors, insufficient early exposure, and the inadequacy of traditional teaching methods. Recent advances in Virtual Reality (VR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) offer promising new approaches to enhance sign language learning through immersive, interactive, and feedback-rich environments. This paper presents a systematic review of 55 peer-reviewed studies on VR-based sign language education, identifying and analyzing five core thematic areas: (1) gesture recognition and real-time feedback mechanisms; (2) interactive VR environments for communicative practice; (3) gamification for immersive and motivating learning experiences; (4) personalized and adaptive learning systems; and (5) accessibility and inclusivity for diverse DHH learners.   The results reveal that AI-driven gesture recognition systems integrated with VR can provide real-time feedback, significantly improving learner engagement and performance. However, the analysis highlights critical challenges: hardware limitations, inconsistent accuracy in gesture recognition, and a lack of inclusive and adaptive design. This review contributes a comprehensive synthesis of technological and pedagogical innovations in the field, outlining current limitations and proposing actionable recommendations for developers and researchers.

This imbalance often results in reduced recommendation quality and unfair exposure of items. Although existing mitigation techniques address this bias to some extent, they typically lack transparency in how they operate. In this paper, we propose a post-hoc method using a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to interpret and mitigate popularity bias in deep recommendation models. The SAE is trained to replicate a pre-trained model's behavior while enabling neuron-level interpretability. By introducing synthetic users with clear preferences for either popular or unpopular items, we identify neurons encoding popularity signals based on their activation patterns. We then adjust the activations of the most biased neurons to steer recommendations toward fairer exposure. Experiments on two public datasets using a sequential recommendation model show that our method significantly improves fairness with minimal impact on accuracy. Moreover, it offers interpretability and fine-grained control over the fairness-accuracy trade-off.",

            "abstract": "Machine learning models increasingly influence decisions in high-stakes settings such as finance, law and hiring, driving the need for transparent, interpretable outcomes. However, while explainable approaches can help understand the decisions being made, they may inadvertently reveal the underlying proprietary algorithm: an undesirable outcome for many practitioners. Consequently, it is crucial to balance meaningful transparency with a form of recourse that clarifies why a decision was made and offers actionable steps following which a favorable outcome can be obtained. Counterfactual explanations offer a powerful mechanism to address this need by showing how specific input changes lead to a more favorable prediction. We propose Model-Agnostic Causally Constrained Counterfactual Generation (MC3G), a novel framework that tackles limitations in the existing counterfactual methods. First, MC3G is model-agnostic: it approximates any black-box model using an explainable rule-based surrogate model. Second, this surrogate is used to generate counterfactuals that produce a favourable outcome for the original underlying black box model. Third, MC3G refines cost computation by excluding the ``effort\" associated with feature changes that occur automatically due to causal dependencies. By focusing only on user-initiated changes, MC3G provides a more realistic and fair representation of the effort needed to achieve a favourable outcome. We show that MC3G delivers more interpretable and actionable counterfactual recommendations compared to existing techniques all while having a lower cost. Our findings highlight MC3G's potential to enhance transparency, accountability, and practical utility in decision-making processes that incorporate machine-learning approaches.",

            "abstract": "In large-scale recommender systems, ultra-long user behavior sequences encode rich signals of evolving interests. Extending sequence length generally improves accuracy, but directly modeling such sequences in production is infeasible due to latency and memory constraints. Existing solutions fall into two categories: (1) top-k retrieval, which truncates the sequence and may discard most attention mass when L >> k; and (2) encoder-based compression, which preserves coverage but often over-compresses and fails to incorporate key context such as temporal gaps or target-aware signals. Neither class achieves a good balance of low-loss compression, context awareness, and efficiency.   We propose VQL, a context-aware Vector Quantization Attention framework for ultra-long behavior modeling, with three innovations. (1) Key-only quantization: only attention keys are quantized, while values remain intact; we prove that softmax normalization yields an error bound independent of sequence length, and a codebook loss directly supervises quantization quality. This also enables L-free inference via offline caches. (2) Multi-scale quantization: attention heads are partitioned into groups, each with its own small codebook, which reduces quantization error while keeping cache size fixed. (3) Efficient context injection: static features (e.g., item category, modality) are directly integrated, and relative position is modeled via a separable temporal kernel. All context is injected without enlarging the codebook, so cached representations remain query-independent.   Experiments on three large-scale datasets (KuaiRand-1K, KuaiRec, TMALL) show that VQL consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving higher accuracy while reducing inference latency, establishing a new state of the art in balancing accuracy and efficiency for ultra-long sequence recommendation.",
