            "abstract": "Traditional recommender systems rely on passive feedback mechanisms that limit users to simple choices such as like and dislike. However, these coarse-grained signals fail to capture users' nuanced behavior motivations and intentions. In turn, current systems cannot also distinguish which specific item attributes drive user satisfaction or dissatisfaction, resulting in inaccurate preference modeling. These fundamental limitations create a persistent gap between user intentions and system interpretations, ultimately undermining user satisfaction and harming system effectiveness.   To address these limitations, we introduce the Interactive Recommendation Feed (IRF), a pioneering paradigm that enables natural language commands within mainstream recommendation feeds. Unlike traditional systems that confine users to passive implicit behavioral influence, IRF empowers active explicit control over recommendation policies through real-time linguistic commands. To support this paradigm, we develop RecBot, a dual-agent architecture where a Parser Agent transforms linguistic expressions into structured preferences and a Planner Agent dynamically orchestrates adaptive tool chains for on-the-fly policy adjustment. To enable practical deployment, we employ simulation-augmented knowledge distillation to achieve efficient performance while maintaining strong reasoning capabilities. Through extensive offline and long-term online experiments, RecBot shows significant improvements in both user satisfaction and business outcomes.",

However, existing systems predominantly focus on unifying retrieval and ranking while neglecting the integration of search and recommendation (S&R) tasks. What makes search and recommendation different is how queries are formed: search uses explicit user requests, while recommendation relies on implicit user interests. As for retrieval versus ranking, the distinction comes down to whether the queries are the target items themselves. Recognizing the query as central element, we propose IntSR, an integrated generative framework for S&R. IntSR integrates these disparate tasks using distinct query modalities. It also addresses the increased computational complexity associated with integrated S&R behaviors and the erroneous pattern learning introduced by a dynamically changing corpus. IntSR has been successfully deployed across various scenarios in Amap, leading to substantial improvements in digital asset's GMV(+3.02%), POI recommendation's CTR(+2.76%), and travel mode suggestion's ACC(+5.13%).",

However, these systems often struggle with redundant and irrelevant information, which can degrade performance. Most existing methods either fuse multimodal information directly or use rigid architectural separation for disentanglement, failing to adequately filter noise and model the complex interplay between modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, the Multimodal Representation-disentangled Information Bottleneck (MRdIB). Concretely, we first employ a Multimodal Information Bottleneck to compress the input representations, effectively filtering out task-irrelevant noise while preserving rich semantic information. Then, we decompose the information based on its relationship with the recommendation target into unique, redundant, and synergistic components. We achieve this decomposition with a series of constraints: a unique information learning objective to preserve modality-unique signals, a redundant information learning objective to minimize overlap, and a synergistic information learning objective to capture emergent information. By optimizing these objectives, MRdIB guides a model to learn more powerful and disentangled representations. Extensive experiments on several competitive models and three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our MRdIB in enhancing multimodal recommendation.",

To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal fusion mechanism in federated recommendation settings (GFMFR).

Moreover, a group-aware item representation fusion approach enables fine-grained knowledge sharing among similar users while retaining individual preferences. The proposed fusion loss could be simply plugged into any existing federated recommender systems empowering their capability by adding multi-modality features. Extensive experiments on five public benchmark datasets demonstrate that GFMFR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal FR baselines.",

In cold start, i.e., when interaction histories of users or items are not available, content-based recommender systems use side information instead. Hybrid recommender systems (HRSs) often employ multimodal learning to combine collaborative and side information, which we jointly refer to as modalities. Though HRSs can provide recommendations when some modalities are missing, their quality degrades. In this work, we utilize single-branch neural networks equipped with weight sharing, modality sampling, and contrastive loss to provide accurate recommendations even in missing modality scenarios by narrowing the modality gap. We compare these networks with multi-branch alternatives and conduct extensive experiments on three datasets. Six accuracy-based and four beyond-accuracy-based metrics help assess the recommendation quality for the different training paradigms and their hyperparameters in warm-start and missing modality scenarios. We quantitatively and qualitatively study the effects of these different aspects on bridging the modality gap. Our results show that single-branch networks achieve competitive performance in warm-start scenarios and are significantly better in missing modality settings. Moreover, our approach leads to closer proximity of an item's modalities in the embedding space. Our full experimental setup is available at https://github.com/hcai-mms/single-branch-networks.",

Our approach first constructs a Global User-Item Interaction Graph (GUIG) from all user behavior sequences, capturing both local and global item associations. Then, a graph contrastive learning module is applied to generate robust embeddings, while a sequential Transformer-based encoder models users' evolving preferences. To further enhance diversity and counteract sparse supervised labels, we employ a GAN-based augmentation strategy, generating plausible interaction patterns and supplementing training data. Extensive experiments on two real-world marketing datasets (Amazon Ads and TikTok Ad Clicks) demonstrate that SeqUDA-Rec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as SASRec, BERT4Rec, and GCL4SR.

We seek to understand interactions with niche items in benchmark recommendation datasets as a step toward mitigating popularity bias. We find that, compared to mainstream users, niche-preferring users exhibit a longer-tailed activity-level distribution, indicating the existence of users who both prefer niche items and exhibit high activity levels. We partition users along two axes: (1) activity level (\"power\" vs. \"light\") and (2) item-popularity preference (\"mainstream\" vs. \"niche\"), and show that in several benchmark datasets, the number of power-niche users (high activity and niche preference) is statistically significantly larger than expected under a null configuration model. Motivated by this observation, we propose a framework for reweighting the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) loss that simultaneously reweights based on user activity level and item popularity. Our method introduces two interpretable parameters: one controlling the significance of user activity level, and the other of item popularity. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that upweighting power-niche users reduces popularity bias and can increase overall performance. In contrast to previous work that only considers user activity level or item popularity in isolation, our results suggest that considering their interaction leads to Pareto-dominant performance.",

            "abstract": "The rapid advancement of generative AI technologies is driving the integration of diverse AI-powered services into smartphones, transforming how users interact with their devices. To simplify access to predefined AI services, this paper introduces MIRA, a pioneering framework for task instruction recommendation that enables intuitive one-touch AI tasking on smartphones. With MIRA, users can long-press on images or text objects to receive contextually relevant instruction recommendations for executing AI tasks. Our work introduces three key innovations: 1) A multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based recommendation pipeline with structured reasoning to extract key entities, infer user intent, and generate precise instructions; 2) A template-augmented reasoning mechanism that integrates high-level reasoning templates, enhancing task inference accuracy; 3) A prefix-tree-based constrained decoding strategy that restricts outputs to predefined instruction candidates, ensuring coherent and intent-aligned suggestions. Through evaluation using a real-world annotated datasets and a user study, MIRA has demonstrated substantial improvements in the accuracy of instruction recommendation. The encouraging results highlight MIRA's potential to revolutionize the way users engage with AI services on their smartphones, offering a more seamless and efficient experience.",

            "abstract": "Generative recommendation plays a crucial role in personalized systems, predicting users' future interactions from their historical behavior sequences. A critical yet underexplored factor in training these models is data augmentation, the process of constructing training data from user interaction histories. By shaping the training distribution, data augmentation directly and often substantially affects model generalization and performance. Nevertheless, in much of the existing work, this process is simplified, applied inconsistently, or treated as a minor design choice, without a systematic and principled understanding of its effects.   Motivated by our empirical finding that different augmentation strategies can yield large performance disparities, we conduct an in-depth analysis of how they reshape training distributions and influence alignment with future targets and generalization to unseen inputs. To systematize this design space, we propose GenPAS, a generalized and principled framework that models augmentation as a stochastic sampling process over input-target pairs with three bias-controlled steps: sequence sampling, target sampling, and input sampling. This formulation unifies widely used strategies as special cases and enables flexible control of the resulting training distribution. Our extensive experiments on benchmark and industrial datasets demonstrate that GenPAS yields superior accuracy, data efficiency, and parameter efficiency compared to existing strategies, providing practical guidance for principled training data construction in generative recommendation.",

            "abstract": "We study a recommendation system where sellers compete for visibility by strategically offering commissions to a platform that optimally curates a ranked menu of items and their respective prices for each customer. Customers interact sequentially with the menu following a cascade click model, and their purchase decisions are influenced by price sensitivity and positions of various items in the menu. We model the seller-platform interaction as a Stackelberg game with sellers as leaders and consider two different games depending on whether the prices are set by the platform or prefixed by the sellers. It is complicated to find the optimal policy of the platform in complete generality; hence, we solve the problem in an important asymptotic regime.   The core contribution of this paper lies in characterizing the equilibrium structure of the limit game. We show that when sellers are of different strengths, the standard Nash equilibrium does not exist due to discontinuities in utilities. We instead establish the existence of a novel equilibrium solution, namely `$\\mu$-connected equilibrium cycle' ($\\mu$-EC), which captures oscillatory strategic responses at the equilibrium. Unlike the (pure) Nash equilibrium, which defines a fixed point of mutual best responses, this is a set-valued solution concept of connected components. This novel equilibrium concept identifies a Cartesian product set of connected action profiles in the continuous action space that satisfies four important properties: stability against external deviations, no external chains, instability against internal deviations, and minimality. We extend a recently introduced solution concept equilibrium cycle to include stability against measure-zero violations and, by avoiding topological difficulties to propose $\\mu$-EC.",

Content-based features or hybrid solutions are common as conventional solutions, but they can only work in a sparse metadata environment with shallow patterns. In this paper, the efficient cold-start recommendation strategy is presented, which is based on the sub word-level representations by applying Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization and pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) embedding in the initialization procedure. We obtain fine-grained token-level vectors that are aligned with the BPE vocabulary as opposed to using coarse-grained sentence embeddings. Together, these token embeddings can be used as dense semantic priors on unseen entities, making immediate recommendation performance possible without user-item interaction history. Our mechanism can be compared to collaborative filtering systems and tested over benchmark datasets with stringent cold-start assumptions. Experimental findings show that the given BPE-LLM method achieves higher Recall@k, NDCG@k, and Hit Rate measurements compared to the standard baseline and displays the same capability of sufficient computational performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that using subword-aware embeddings yields better generalizability and is more interpretable, especially within a multilingual and sparse input setting. The practical application of token-level semantic initialization as a lightweight, but nevertheless effective extension to modern recommender systems in the zero-shot setting is indicated within this work.",

Can we trust Large Language Models to serve as reliable judges of their own kind? This paper investigates LLM-as-a-Judge as a principled approach to evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems in legal contexts, where the stakes of recommendation quality are exceptionally high.   We tackle two fundamental questions that determine practical viability: which inter-rater reliability metrics best capture the alignment between LLM and human assessments, and how do we conduct statistically sound comparisons between competing systems? Through systematic experimentation, we discover that traditional agreement metrics like Krippendorff's alpha can be misleading in the skewed distributions typical of AI system evaluations. Instead, Gwet's AC2 and rank correlation coefficients emerge as more robust indicators for judge selection, while the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test with Benjamini-Hochberg corrections provides the statistical rigor needed for reliable system comparisons.   Our findings suggest a path toward scalable, cost-effective evaluation that maintains the precision demanded by legal applications, transforming what was once a human-intensive bottleneck into an automated, yet statistically principled, evaluation framework.",

            "abstract": "Generative paradigm, especially powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), has emerged as a new solution to the next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation. Pioneering studies usually adopt a two-stage pipeline, starting with a tokenizer converting POIs into discrete identifiers that can be processed by LLMs, followed by POI behavior prediction tasks to instruction-tune LLM for next POI recommendation. Despite of remarkable progress, they still face two limitations: (1) existing tokenizers struggle to encode heterogeneous signals in the recommendation data, suffering from information loss issue, and (2) previous instruction-tuning tasks only focus on users' POI visit behavior while ignore other behavior types, resulting in insufficient understanding of mobility. To address these limitations, we propose KGTB (Knowledge Graph Tokenization for Behavior-aware generative next POI recommendation). Specifically, KGTB organizes the recommendation data in a knowledge graph (KG) format, of which the structure can seamlessly preserve the heterogeneous information. Then, a KG-based tokenizer is developed to quantize each node into an individual structural ID. This process is supervised by the KG's structure, thus reducing the loss of heterogeneous information. Using generated IDs, KGTB proposes multi-behavior learning that introduces multiple behavior-specific prediction tasks for LLM fine-tuning, e.g., POI, category, and region visit behaviors. Learning on these behavior tasks provides LLMs with comprehensive insights on the target POI visit behavior. Experiments on four real-world city datasets demonstrate the superior performance of KGTB.",

This work explores bypassing language-space decoding by directly matching candidate items with the LLM's internal thought representations in the latent space, eliminating the time-consuming autoregressive process to reduce computational costs. Towards this, we introduce Light Latent-space Decoding (L2D), an effective and efficient latent-space decoding method. L2D represents user-preferred items by using the hidden states of test sequences reflecting the LLM's internal thought, and obtains candidate item representations from the hidden states of training sequences labeled with the corresponding candidate items. It then matches the two types of representations to decode items, achieving latent-space decoding. In this way, it enables efficient decoding without altering the LLM's generative tuning paradigm, thereby preserving performance. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that L2D is more than 10x faster than language-space decoding while maintaining or enhancing performance.",

SPARK first employs Tucker low-rank decomposition to denoise KGs and generate robust entity representations. Subsequently, an SVD-initialized hybrid geometric GNN concurrently learns representations in Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces; the latter is strategically leveraged for its aptitude in modeling hierarchical structures, effectively capturing semantic features of sparse, long-tail items. A core contribution is an item popularity-aware adaptive fusion strategy that dynamically weights signals from collaborative filtering, refined KG embeddings, and diverse geometric spaces for precise modeling of both mainstream and long-tail items. Finally, contrastive learning aligns these multi-source representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate SPARK's significant superiority over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in improving long-tail item recommendation, offering a robust, principled approach to knowledge-enhanced recommendation.

To ensure global connectivity, ISPs can either use transit service(s) or establish direct peering relationships between themselves via Internet exchange points (IXPs). Peering offers more room for ISP-specific optimizations and is preferred, but it often involves a lengthy and complex process. Automating peering partner selection can enhance efficiency in the global Internet ecosystem. We explore the use of publicly available data on ISPs to develop a machine learning (ML) model that can predict whether an ISP pair should peer or not. At first, we explore public databases, e.g., PeeringDB, CAIDA, etc., to gather data on ISPs. Then, we evaluate the performance of three broad types of ML models for predicting peering relationships: tree-based, neural network-based, and transformer-based. Among these, we observe that tree-based models achieve the highest accuracy and efficiency in our experiments. The XGBoost model trained with publicly available data showed promising performance, with a 98% accuracy rate in predicting peering partners. In addition, the model demonstrated great resilience to variations in time, space, and missing data. We envision that ISPs can adopt our method to fully automate the peering partner selection process, thus transitioning to a more efficient and optimized Internet ecosystem.",

However, most existing methods rely on either static fusion strategies or graph-based local interaction modeling, facing two critical limitations: (1) insufficient ability to model fine-grained cross-modal associations, leading to suboptimal fusion quality; and (2) a lack of global distribution-level consistency, causing representational bias. To address these, we propose MambaRec, a novel framework that integrates local feature alignment and global distribution regularization via attention-guided learning. At its core, we introduce the Dilated Refinement Attention Module (DREAM), which uses multi-scale dilated convolutions with channel-wise and spatial attention to align fine-grained semantic patterns between visual and textual modalities. This module captures hierarchical relationships and context-aware associations, improving cross-modal semantic modeling. Additionally, we apply Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and contrastive loss functions to constrain global modality alignment, enhancing semantic consistency. This dual regularization reduces mode-specific deviations and boosts robustness. To improve scalability, MambaRec employs a dimensionality reduction strategy to lower the computational cost of high-dimensional multimodal features. Extensive experiments on real-world e-commerce datasets show that MambaRec outperforms existing methods in fusion quality, generalization, and efficiency.

            "abstract": "The cold-start user issue further compromises the effectiveness of recommender systems in limiting access to the historical behavioral information. It is an effective pipeline to optimize instructional prompts on a few-shot large language model (LLM) used in recommender tasks. We introduce a context-conditioned prompt formulation method P(u,\\ Ds)\\ \\rightarrow\\ R\\widehat, where u is a cold-start user profile, Ds is a curated support set, and R\\widehat is the predicted ranked list of items. Based on systematic experimentation with transformer-based autoregressive LLMs (BioGPT, LLaMA-2, GPT-4), we provide empirical evidence that optimal exemplar injection and instruction structuring can significantly improve the precision@k and NDCG scores of such models in low-data settings. The pipeline uses token-level alignments and embedding space regularization with a greater semantic fidelity. Our findings not only show that timely composition is not merely syntactic but also functional as it is in direct control of attention scales and decoder conduct through inference. This paper shows that prompt-based adaptation may be considered one of the ways to address cold-start recommendation issues in LLM-based pipelines.",

This paper describes headway control pilots conducted in two high-ridership Chicago bus routes between 2022 and 2023. A decision support system was developed for a bus holding strategy based on a reinforcement learning approach. For the pilots, a user interface enabled supervisors to monitor service and record applied actions. The first pilot tested terminal-based holding on a route affected by missed trips from absenteeism. The analysis found improvements in reliability, and the application of control was shown to outperform days with more service. The second pilot applied en-route holding in a high-ridership bus route in Chicago. The evaluation showed wait time improvements with rippled benefits to stops downstream, and a reduction in transfer times from connecting bus and rail lines. Compliance analysis based on the supervisor logs on the app revealed mixed compliance levels from drivers, which were related to the mentality of schedule adherence and seniority. Recommendations are provided for practitioners to scale similar efforts.",

This limits their applicability in dynamic environments where user preferences evolve. Incremental learning offers a promising solution, yet conventional methods from computer vision or NLP face challenges in recommendation tasks due to data sparsity and distinct task paradigms. Existing approaches for neural recommenders remain limited and often lack generalizability. To address this, we propose MEGG, Replay Samples with Maximally Extreme GGscore, an experience replay based incremental learning framework. MEGG introduces GGscore, a novel metric that quantifies sample influence, enabling the selective replay of highly influential samples to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Being model-agnostic, MEGG integrates seamlessly across architectures and frameworks. Experiments on three neural models and four benchmark datasets show superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines, with strong scalability, efficiency, and robustness.

However, there is growing concern about the adverse effects of these systems, including their potential tendency to expose users to sensitive or harmful material, negatively impacting overall well-being. To address this concern quantitatively, it is necessary to create datasets with relevant sensitivity labels for content, enabling researchers to evaluate personalized systems beyond mere engagement metrics. To this end, we introduce two novel datasets that include a taxonomy of sensitivity labels alongside user-content ratings: one that integrates MovieLens rating data with content warnings from the Does the Dog Die? community ratings website, and another that combines fan-fiction interaction data and user-generated warnings from Archive of Our Own.",

Instead of retraining models or relying on opaque heuristics, our method restructures a user's Personalized Knowledge Graph (PKG) to suppress feature co-occurrence patterns that reinforce Personalized Information Environments (PIEs), i.e., algorithmically induced filter bubbles that constrain content diversity. These adapted PKGs are used to construct structured prompts that steer the language model toward more diverse, Out-PIE recommendations while preserving topical relevance. We introduce a family of symbolic adaptation strategies, including soft reweighting, hard inversion, and targeted removal of biased triples, and a client-side learning algorithm that optimizes their application per user. Experiments on a recipe recommendation benchmark show that personalized PKG adaptations significantly increase content novelty while maintaining recommendation quality, outperforming global adaptation and naive prompt-based methods.",
